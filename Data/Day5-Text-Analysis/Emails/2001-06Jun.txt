Ms. Segrest:  
 
Is this an example of what your influence does (re: Dr. Phil Marty’s message, below)?  I have no less than reported a murder to you and to a number of other university officials, including the deans of the College of Public Health.  What makes them (and you?) think they/you have the lawful option of doing nothing?  To do so is to aid and abet – serve as an accessory after the fact…
 
It is also my understanding that to do so any one of us would run the very serious risk of at the very least committing misprision of felony, and considering the extent – including, but not limited to the fact that this is a sworn, unchallenged claim that has been in the public record for almost two records and no investigation has been initiated, neither have any arrests been made or prosecutions commenced – misprision of treason.  If I am incorrect on that point, I request that you so advise me at once.

I am honored.  Do you have any suggestions concerning how I can be more successful in helping the community?  
 
Please keep abreast of the city of Homestead and their financial health.  The city has major problems.  I am also concerned about Opa-Locka, and two other smaller municipalities.  Almost all the municipalities have co-opted some of Hurricane  Andrew's FEMA money giving them past solvency and the money is now either spent or coming due. 
 
Another problem is small municipalities cannot attract seasoned city managers and it is difficult to recruit qualified financial staff.  The city managers are nice people but not financial fireball's with a thorough understanding of all of a city's financial obligations and there long term ramifications.
 
I thank you again for reading the Watchdog Report.

Dear Governor Bush:

Your recent veto of transportation bill CS HB 1053/SB 2056 reflected true 
concern for the rights and opinions of the people of Florida, and the scenic 
value of the land we all share. Speaking for the Board of Directors of 
Citizens for a Scenic Florida I would like to express deep appreciation for 
the wisdom and clarity of thought you invested in your decision to veto the 
bill. The terrible amendments it carried would have been devastating for 
Florida in many ways.  

Florida's residents are acutely aware of the need to protect the natural 
beauty with which our state is blessed, and very actively work for its 
preservation and protection. Your support of their values is a heartening 
example of how our governing process was intended to function, and was met 
with widespread gratitude.

Gov. Bush,
In an email last week you asked me why Bay District (like others) are or
could have a budget crunching year.  Here is a few items from our budget
office here in Bay County.

Total increase in funding			$ 4,092,018
	For Bay County the increase is 3.29% per FTE

   *Categorical*
	School Recognition 			- 1,112,223
	Teacher Retention/Bonus	-   643,723
	Instructional material		-   202,875
	Prorated holdback 00-01		-   590,480
	Growth funding				-   362,585

NET INCREASE					$ 1,125,391

Therefore, the "discretionary" funding increase is less than 1%

Jeb, don't get me wrong... we in Bay County will "make it", but the fact
as I see it is an increase of less than 1% .

As you know, we are in the budget preparation stage (as a Board) now. I
will keep you posted.

After stating all that,  I GLAD YOUR MY GOVERNOR AND THAT YOU ARE
RUNNING AND WILL CAPTURE ANOTHER TERM.  You are truly doing a great job.

Yes. We got an email regarding this person last week. I responded to Mr. Gott's email and have since been looking into the matter. Mr. Garner is serving a 30 year sentence for manslaughter and isn't due to be released until 2025.  Unlike most prisoners, he is being housed in his home town, which gives his family the opportunity to see him frequently.

My dear Governor Bush:
 
It has been my privilege to minister to prisoners through a program entitled "Kairos."  My first encounter as a "Godparent" there was with a young man named Michael Garner (VO4349).  I was struck by his complete candor, honesty, and his past responsibilities to his work, his family and his good citizenship.  He has a wife and two young children, and they are intensely loyal in visiting every week-end, and appear to be a very loving family.  
 
It is my understanding that Michael has been in the Kairos program for about 1-1/2 years now, and these past six months has been promoted to the title of "Encourager," which means he is responsible for stimulating the other inmates to become better God-fearing men who will become responsible citizens upon their release, or, in the case that there is no hope of release, that they graduate from the program and teach others what they have learned about anger control, responsibility to our neighbor, and to learn to trust in one another AND most of all, in God.  This man is a real example to others, and I have reason to believe that he is not responsible for what put him behind bars, since it was apparently due to a reaction to prescription medication which caused a complete change in his rational thinking and behavior.  
 
If you would only give this beautiful young man a chance by interceding for him,  I am sure you would be taking the only conscienable action that can be done.  Please accept my sincere thanks for your looking into this matter.  He is not a rich man, but he tells me even his church has had a drive to raise enough money to pay for legal fees to go forward on his behalf.   I believe in you, Mr. Bush, and in your family.  I know you to be a fair and honest governor.  I voted for you because of that, and am counting on you to keep up the good work you have been doing for our State of Florida.  Please look into the Kairos program - it is a world wide program promoting Christian values and we find the recidivism rate is unbelievable in those who graduate from the program.
 
Thank you.

For too long, the improvement of the nation's infrastructure has been

What a shame....
I realize that this and my previous E-mail did not go directly to the Governor. I understand from inside sources that several people are responsible for the responses that we average citizens get from this E address. But, I was hoping that this avenue would enable me to move forward with my desire to serve the people of my community and state.
It's been almost 3 months since this original correspondence and I am still waiting for some kind of direction. Commissioner Crist's office sent me a nice note, but nothing since. I have attended 2 separate functions recently that both the Governor and Lt. Governor were at as well. I heard them speak about children needing safe learning environments, but I don't understand why someone like me is not being offered the opportunity to volunteer my efforts.
While I agree that Resource Officers are needed to combat this problem, I think parent involvement may be even more crucial. Wouldn't it be better if we addressed the real issues of violent youths instead of standing prepared with a bandaid
when the situation explodes onto our campuses? Schools cannot begin to teach literacy skills to Little Johnny while he is concerned about getting shot in the hall. Parents must be a part of the answer.

Roxanna, thank you for your email. The state is proactive in its approach to school safety issues but there is more that we can do. 
 
My personal belief is that we should expand the school resource officer concept as the first, best way to deal with school violence. The use of police officers in schools is the ultimate form of community policing. HOtlines, counseling, prevention education, assessment activities are being done throughout the state. Again, we should always strive to do better.
 
I am passing on your email to Commissioner Charlie Crist so that he can get you involved in the safety efforts in some way. Charlie is a leader in this policy area.

Subject: School Safety


As a multi-generation Floridian who is proud of her heritage, and our state, I write to you with a heavy heart for our children.
Last school year, there were more than 180,000 reports of crime and violence in Florida schools. My own personal experience has been at a High School where we lost a student to gun violence in our student parking lot. Our usually quiet community was rocked and still bears the scars of lost innocence and security shaken. 
I am proud to say that as a school family, we are healing and moving on. However, our own tragic experience and the reported numbers tell us that we must be pro-active in preventing the kind of pain that our community endured.
What steps are being taken through your office to address today's school safety issues? Having lived the nightmare, it is important to me to know that we are moving in a direction that will facilitate safe learning environments for the children of our state. I also ask not only what your office is doing, but what can I personally do to be a part of the solution. I believe that ultimately, my unsolicited education with our own crisis happened in my life for a reason. I would welcome the opportunity to be a constructive force in providing my own children and others the means to attend school without fear.
                                         Respectfully,
                                         Roxanna M. Torre

Unfortunately, a staff person from DCA asked them to fill out the state
forms because she thought it would help provide additional information about
the extent of the problem and impact.  

Re state help.  There are no established/on-going state programs which
provide financial assistance to small businesses other than very highly
targeted programs like the BBIB.  The only possible source of state
assistance would be to activate the Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan
Program - which has been activated five times in the aftermath of disasters:
Hurricane Andrew, the Winter Storm of 1993, the Northwest Florida Floods,
Hurricane Opal, and Hurricane Georges.

Frank Koutnik and Shirley Collins of DCA have indicated that there is $3.4MM
in the Non Declared Disaster Trust Fund which could be accessed if the Small
Business Emergency Bridge Loan program were activated.  However, the
information asked for in the SBA forms is not adequate to provide an idea of
how much money would be needed to provide assistance. 

I will continue to work with all appropriate to resolve.

Katie asked me to e-mail you this information.

Katie spoke with Jim Loftus at DCA and he spoke with the SBA contact for
Florida this morning.  This gentleman from SBA reiterated to Jim that to
receive SBA monies an area must be declared a disaster area, and no disaster
declaration exists for drought conditions.

The business owners yesterday mentioned that they had been told to fill out
paperwork detailing financial loses for SBA by July 5th.  And from the
information we are getting from SBA they still won't qualify for funds.

Jim Loftus is working with DEP ans SBA to clearify what help will be
available, but I did want to bring this to your attention.

KEn, you bring up a policy question that has been around for a long while. We do spend more through direct appropriation and less on tuition. I think we should have gradual increases in tuition, greater accountability that more of the money  goes to the classroom and continued funding by the state.

Jeb,

Great selections!

As usual the liberal journalists at The Tampa Tribune yesterday found fault, 
reciting the tired list of political correctness - color, women, poor, 
educationists, etc.. Today the Trib's editorialists weighed in with a more 
positive opinion. But too many folks that  I encounter have already been 
brain-washed by the unending whinging of the left against the education 
reform. I truly admire your sticking to the plan, because I know that 
empowering the local trustees is the best path to the future.

What I see is the appointment of a Board with really good , experienced and 
truly talented people who can help Judy Genschaft accelerate the drive for 
excellence, not just more students, at USF. That and that alone should be the 
criteria for selection and you did it well. 

One thing I am still puzzled by is the price and cost  situation. I don't 
think the cost per student year at a Florida university is so much less than 
at Harvard, Stanford, Michigan or North Carolina that we can afford to under 
price them by so great an amount. The difference must be in the amount of 
state subsidy or [income from the endowment for a private school]. Why should 
wealthy parents of Florida students be getting this huge discount on college 
tuition? If we were to charge a market price to those who could afford to pay 
it and give scholarship assistance to those who can't afford to pay, it seems 
to me the result would be additional monies to improve the academic aspects 
of our universities? I wonder how long we can continue to use the state 
budget to fund more and more university education at below market prices.

Keep up the good job - we will win in '02

Best regards,  Ken Hoyt

	use that board as a springboard to their political career.  I

In an email last week you asked me why Bay District (like others) are or
could have a budget crunching year.  Here is a few items from our budget
office here in Bay County.

Total increase in funding			$ 4,092,018
	For Bay County the increase is 3.29% per FTE

   *Categorical*
	School Recognition 			- 1,112,223
	Teacher Retention/Bonus	-   643,723
	Instructional material		-   202,875
	Prorated holdback 00-01		-   590,480
	Growth funding				-   362,585

NET INCREASE					$ 1,125,391

Therefore, the "discretionary" funding increase is less than 1%

Jeb, don't get me wrong... we in Bay County will "make it", but the fact
as I see it is an increase of less than 1% .

As you know, we are in the budget preparation stage (as a Board) now. I

I just received a letter addressed to you from death row inmate, Robert
Trease.  Mr. Trease wishes to waive all his appeals and any and all clemency
in his case.  He is asking that his death sentence be carried out "as
expeditiously as possible."

On June 5, I sent a letter to Janet Keels asking her to initiate a clemency
investigation, which includes having clemency counsel appointed to represent
Mr. Trease.  In Mr. Trease's letter, he specifically states that he does not
want clemency counsel appointed and he is waiving his right to appear at any
stage of the clemency process. He sent a copy of this letter to Janet Keels
as well.

How would you like to proceed under these circumstances?  A background
investigation can be completed without cooperation from the inmate.

Subject:	School Board 

School Board Members:

Upon review of the statutes I believe the School Board is allowed to make 
rules regarding personnel matters.  This is in F.S. 231.001.  

 The 2000 Florida Statutes
 
 Title XVI
EDUCATION Chapter 231
Personnel Of School System 
 
231.001  School district personnel policies.--Except as otherwise provided by 
law or the State Constitution, district school boards may prescribe rules 
governing personnel matters, including the assignment of duties and 
responsibilities for all district employees. 

History.--ss. 3, 31, ch. 82-242; s. 5, ch. 84-94; s. 7, ch. 92-67; s. 6, ch. 
2000-301. 
 
There is no legitimate reason for the board, senior staff, board attorneys, 
or Dr. DiPatri to forbid interested members of the voting public from 
attending, without participating in, interviews for a position that effects 
literally thousands of people within a community.  As the School Board, you 
should  welcome the participation of parents and community members who 
express an interest in our school system! 

The Board has the ability to pass rules allowing parents, teachers and 
community members into screening interviews of candidates for Principal at 
local schools.  I believe the School Board should exercise that authority and 
override the misguided staff decisions that create an atmosphere of distrust 
among your constituents.  Think about it.  How can the school district  
deliberately try to stifle meaningful participation by interested citizens 
and then turn around and ask those same voting citizens for more money?  That 
approach to education in the open government environment that is embodied in 
our state Constitution, is counterproductive and simply causes voters to 
question everything the School District does!   The School Districts history 
of failed financing referenda is compelling evidence in support of my point.

I therefore find it dumbfounding and outrightly hypocritical, that less than 
a month after the public unveiling of  Dr. Dipatri's First in Florida plan 
[which claims to welcome parents and community members at the highest levels 
of participation] the District Superintendent supports his area 
superintendent and staff in their efforts to prevent an interested parent 
from obtaining any timely information about the candidates for the job of 
principal at her child's middle school, where the parent is also a School 
Advisory Council member.  The hypocrisy was underscored by the district 
staff's failure to make the  candidates' voluminous personnel files available 
for review until an hour and a half before the Board meeting at which the 
Superintendent expected the School Board to act upon the candidate he had 
reccomended/nominated for the job. Those public records had been requested a 
week earlier on the day after the date set as the deadline for filing 
applications.  When the files were finally produced, the candidates had 
already been interviewed and ranked by a committee, only composed of senior 
staff, in a closed meeting and the nominee had been selected by the 
Superintendent.  I, as the interested parent, was still reviewing the files 
as the School Board met and voted to approve the Superintendent's nominee.  I 
was effectively denied any chance to provide meaningful input to the Board, 
whether positive or critical.  And the final blow?  At this "fait  accompli" 
stage of the process, the staff "could not find" the file for one of the 
local candidates!  
 
Is it any wonder that the School District suffers from a lack of credibility?

I want you to know clearly that I was not dissappointed with your response. I certainly was not arguing your point regarding Resource Officers, we depend on them. However, my personal experiances combined with documented research states the case for the importance of parental involvement at school and in their homes. Most of the shooters to date have come from homes where the parents were not aware of their child's activities or need for help prior to the shootings.
A representative from your office has already called me this morning to refer me to the Safe & Drug Free Schools program. I will make that contact this morning and look forward to telling you in the future of my contributions to their efforts.

What a shame....
I realize that this and my previous E-mail did not go directly to the Governor. I understand from inside sources that several people are responsible for the responses that we average citizens get from this E address. But, I was hoping that this avenue would enable me to move forward with my desire to serve the people of my community and state.
It's been almost 3 months since this original correspondence and I am still waiting for some kind of direction. Commissioner Crist's office sent me a nice note, but nothing since. I have attended 2 separate functions recently that both the Governor and Lt. Governor were at as well. I heard them speak about children needing safe learning environments, but I don't understand why someone like me is not being offered the opportunity to volunteer my efforts.
While I agree that Resource Officers are needed to combat this problem, I think parent involvement may be even more crucial. Wouldn't it be better if we addressed the real issues of violent youths instead of standing prepared with a bandaid
when the situation explodes onto our campuses? Schools cannot begin to teach literacy skills to Little Johnny while he is concerned about getting shot in the hall. Parents must be a part of the answer.
The response I got from my original E-mail led me to believe that I had connected with the right offices/people. I was fired up and ready to go.... what happened?

Roxanna, thank you for your email. The state is proactive in its approach to school safety issues but there is more that we can do. 
 
My personal belief is that we should expand the school resource officer concept as the first, best way to deal with school violence. The use of police officers in schools is the ultimate form of community policing. HOtlines, counseling, prevention education, assessment activities are being done throughout the state. Again, we should always strive to do better.
 
I am passing on your email to Commissioner Charlie Crist so that he can get you involved in the safety efforts in some way. Charlie is a leader in this policy area.

As a multi-generation Floridian who is proud of her heritage, and our state, I write to you with a heavy heart for our children.
Last school year, there were more than 180,000 reports of crime and violence in Florida schools. My own personal experience has been at a High School where we lost a student to gun violence in our student parking lot. Our usually quiet community was rocked and still bears the scars of lost innocence and security shaken. 
I am proud to say that as a school family, we are healing and moving on. However, our own tragic experience and the reported numbers tell us that we must be pro-active in preventing the kind of pain that our community endured.
What steps are being taken through your office to address today's school safety issues? Having lived the nightmare, it is important to me to know that we are moving in a direction that will facilitate safe learning environments for the children of our state. I also ask not only what your office is doing, but what can I personally do to be a part of the solution. I believe that ultimately, my unsolicited education with our own crisis happened in my life for a reason. I would welcome the opportunity to be a constructive force in providing my own children and others the means to attend school without fear.
                                         Respectfully,

Russia Plans Soyuz Launches from Europe’s South American Spaceport --
Russia is ready to invest $250 million to prepare Europe’s Kourou
spaceport in French Guiana for launching Soyuz rockets, according to
Orbital Report. 

Russian Space Budget to Increase -- According to Space News, Russia's
proposed 2002 federal budget provides a 43% increase for civil space
expenditures (totaling $282 million), and a several-fold increase for
military space programs.  Military space spending may be used to replace
many Russian military satellites that are operating beyond their designed
lifespans.

Italy Develops Vega Design, Plans Kourou Launches -- The Italian Space
Agency has submitted its design for the Vega small launch vehicle to the
European Space Agency for a Preliminary Design Review.  According to
Orbital Report, the vehicle will be operated by Europe’s Arianespace
consortium and will be launched from Europe’s Kourou spaceport in French
Guiana.   

Lockheed Martin Plans Japanese Launch Venture -- According to Orbital
Report, Lockheed Martin will provide Atlas hardware to support Japan’s
Galaxy Express venture to provide launch services using J-2 launch
vehicles.

Boeing Plans Japanese Launch Venture -- Boeing is developing a broad
cooperative agreement with Mitsubishi that will include the launch of one
Delta IV mission, with options for up to five more between 2002 and 2007,
according to Space News. 

Australia Plans $51 Million Spaceport Investment -- According to Orbital
Report, Australia is planning a $51 million investment in a commercial
Asia Pacific Space Center project to develop a $415 million spaceport on
Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.

New Atlas V Launch Planned -- According to Satellite Today, Telesat
Canada has selected Lockheed Martin to build and launch its Nimiq-2
satellite aboard an Atlas V rocket from the Cape Canaveral Spaceport in
late 2002.  A Russian Proton rocket will provide a backup launch option.

Florida Researchers Win NASA BioTech Research Grants -- NASA has awarded
grants to four Florida university researchers to conduct biomedical
research on earth and in space.  Grants will go to: Dr. Jeanne Becker at
the University of South Florida for “3-D Growth Effects on Drug
Resistance in Human Ovarian Tumor Cells;” Dr. Luca Inverardi of the
University of Miami for “Cell Transplantation Therapy for Diabetes
Utilizing Immunoprivileged Sertoli-Islet Cell Aggregates;” and Dr. Samuel
Saporta of the University of South Florida for “Creation and
Transplantation of Immunoprivileged Sertoli-Neuron- Aggregated-Cells
(SNACs) for the Treatment of Parkinson Disease.”

NASA Bioscience Research Budget Raises Concerns -- NASA’s proposed
restructured Space Station research program, which is designed to be
consistent with the President’s FY-2002 budget, has generated calls for
change by the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology.  In
an alert posted on SpaceRef.com, the ASGSB says that NASA’s Biological
Research Project has been cut by nearly 80%, and the lack of a Crew
Return Vehicle will limit the Station’s crew to only three people, with a
maximum of only 20 hours per week for research support.  ASGSB encourages
grassroots action to convince Congress and NASA to restore Space Station
research funding, perhaps through Congressional markups of NASA’s budget
on July 10 (House) and July 18 (Senate). Meanwhile, Congressman George
Nethercutt of Washington seeks to include additional funding for a
research-oriented Shuttle mission, as a way to keep scientific research
in space underway during an otherwise "dry spell" wherein little or no
science is being done while NASA focuses on the construction of the Space
Station.

Study Finds Launch Industry Has Excess Capacity -- According to
SpaceRef.com, the excess capacity in worldwide space launch services is
now at 35% and growing, according to a study by Booz-Allen and Hamilton. 
Details of the study, which looked at the entire U.S. space industrial
base, were presented by former Air Force Gen. Thomas Moorman (a rumored
candidate to become NASA’s next administrator) to the House Subcommittee
on Space and Aeronautics.

Boeing Invests in Air-Launched Booster -- Boeing has invested $3 million
in 2001 to continue design planning for its proposed winged AirLaunch
expendable rocket, which would be released from atop a 747 aircraft (the
same one used to carry the Space Shuttle).  According to Orbital Report,
the vehicle could be used to launch the Air Force’s Space Maneuver
Vehicle (based on the current X-37 program).

Rohrbacher Seeks More Military Funds for X-37 -- According to Space News,
California Congressman Dana Rohrbacher, in a letter to Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, has suggested that the X-37 experimental spaceplane will
be unable to fly in 2004 without a larger Air Force contribution.  X-37
is currently a joint NASA/Air Force initiative.  The Air Force recently
announced a $10.4 million contract (with options for up to $29.9 million)
with Aerojet to work on an Advanced Reusable Rocket Engine that could
power the proposed X-37-based Space Maneuver Vehicle.

Florida Participates in Bio-2001 Event -- Representatives from the
Florida Space Research Institute, Spaceport Florida Authority, Enterprise
Florida, and NASA Kennedy Space Center attended this week's Bio-2001
event in San Diego to discuss Florida/NASA plans for a
life-sciences-oriented Space Experiment Research & Processing Laboratory

Dear Governor:

As you know, I recommended to you that you nominate Hugo Menendez to fill
the School Board seat vacated by Demetrio Perez.  I believe that Hugo is
eminently qualified and has the strength of character, the ethics and the
experience to help clean the problems which plague the system.

Hugo's selection would send a clear signal that things need to change.  It
would be a departure from the more politically inclined nominees, but I
believe that is exactly what we need.  Hugo is also an educator to boot.
You know how concerned I have been with the ethical lapses that have tarred
our image.  The School system is too important.  Education is your number 1
priority.

However, I have heard that you are seriously considering Frank Bolanos.  I
have known Frank for a very long time, and I believe he has high ethical
standards and is deeply committed to work hard to shape things up.

While I believe Hugo to be the outstanding candidate, choosing Frank will
also be an excellent choice.

Best regards, and as always, you can count on my support

this appears to be completely a local issue/association issue with legal
precedent -- however, if this becomes a problem, the state could pass a
pro-flag law pre-empting the associations and ordinances of localities.  The
law would essentially protect the rights of homeowners to fly the flag
without retribution -- tailored carefully -- there may be circumstances that
would be unreasonable -- like one of those large flags that is 50 feet by 50
feet -- things like that the law might take into consideration.  however,
hopefully this can be resolved at the local level in a reasonable manner.

Sounds good.  What about a removable type flag pole so it can be placed in an

be simular to portable basketball hoops in the driveway which most HOA's

Yes. We got an email regarding this person last week. I responded to Mr. Gott's email and have since been looking into the matter. Mr. Garner is serving a 30 year sentence for manslaughter and isn't due to be released until 2025.  Unlike most prisoners, he is being housed in his home town, which gives his family the opportunity to see him frequently.

My dear Governor Bush:
 
It has been my privilege to minister to prisoners through a program entitled "Kairos."  My first encounter as a "Godparent" there was with a young man named Michael Garner (VO4349).  I was struck by his complete candor, honesty, and his past responsibilities to his work, his family and his good citizenship.  He has a wife and two young children, and they are intensely loyal in visiting every week-end, and appear to be a very loving family.  
 
It is my understanding that Michael has been in the Kairos program for about 1-1/2 years now, and these past six months has been promoted to the title of "Encourager," which means he is responsible for stimulating the other inmates to become better God-fearing men who will become responsible citizens upon their release, or, in the case that there is no hope of release, that they graduate from the program and teach others what they have learned about anger control, responsibility to our neighbor, and to learn to trust in one another AND most of all, in God.  This man is a real example to others, and I have reason to believe that he is not responsible for what put him behind bars, since it was apparently due to a reaction to prescription medication which caused a complete change in his rational thinking and behavior.  
 
If you would only give this beautiful young man a chance by interceding for him,  I am sure you would be taking the only conscienable action that can be done.  Please accept my sincere thanks for your looking into this matter.  He is not a rich man, but he tells me even his church has had a drive to raise enough money to pay for legal fees to go forward on his behalf.   I believe in you, Mr. Bush, and in your family.  I know you to be a fair and honest governor.  I voted for you because of that, and am counting on you to keep up the good work you have been doing for our State of Florida.  Please look into the Kairos program - it is a world wide program promoting Christian values and we find the recidivism rate is unbelievable in those who graduate from the program.
 
Thank you.

Dagmar Dow, 43, recovers Thursday at Tampa General Hospital. An alligator in a Pasco County lake nearly severed her left foot and left deep wounds on her right arm.

  _____  


TAMPA -- Dagmar Dow never saw the 9-foot-8, 350-pound alligator that jerked her under water as she swam at a local nudist resort. 


"I knew something had pulled me under, that's it," Dow, 43, said Thursday from her bed at Tampa General Hospital. "It just went down so fast. I was more in shock probably than pain." 


Her husband, Ray Dow, repeatedly kicked the alligator as he pulled his wife ashore. 


"I looked over at my wife and she went down, like if you can picture one of the scenes out of Jaws," said Ray Dow, who was swimming nearby. "It was like a giant vacuum cleaner sucked her under water." 


The attack at 2:45 p.m. Wednesday at the Lake Como nudist resort in Pasco County nearly severed Dagmar Dow's left foot and left deep lacerations on her right arm. Doctors operated Wednesday and scheduled two more surgeries for today and Monday. It is not clear yet if the foot can be saved, her husband said. 


The attack left the Dows angry, not at the gator but at people who have been feeding it. The Dows, who have hired an attorney, cited several previous complaints about the gator, suggesting it should have been removed before the attack. 


The couple moved to the resort about six months ago from Arizona. Before that, they spent time in Wyoming and Montana. Alligators were a new experience. 


"Alligator was not the first thing that crossed my mind," Ray Dow said. "I was just kicking whatever was pulling her down. I was just trying to get her to shore." 


He said he was terrified at what he saw when they got there. 


"I picked her up and saw her foot handing by a couple of pieces of flesh and sinew," he said. "We swim in the lake every day. If there are any alligators within sight, we don't go out. That alligator was never visible on the surface of the water until after the attack." 


The Dows, who don't have health insurance, were practicing for a scuba diving test in preparation for a trip to the Florida Keys. 


Nearby were their two sons, Dustin, 12, and Raphael, 15. Another son, Tibor, 20, was camping in Montana, Ray Dow said. 


Propped up in her hospital bed, with bandages from her right shoulder down to her wrist, Dagmar Dow said she always felt safe swimming in Big Moss Lake, the centerpiece of the resort. 


The couple said they were aware that alligators lived in the lake, but nothing as large or dangerous as the one that attacked. 


"Everybody said it would be safe, but you shouldn't swim at night," she said. "They said the daytime would be fine." 


Florida Fish and Wildlife officials said the alligator probably has lost its fear of humans. 


That drew the brunt of the Dows' ire. 


"My and my wife's anger is not directed at the alligator or anything else, other than the idiots feeding the alligators," said Ray Dow, a computer programmer. "I hope we find out who it was, and I hope they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." 


Feeding alligators is a second-degree misdemeanor in Florida. It is punishable by up to $500 in fines or 60 days in jail. 


Their New Jersey attorney, Clifford Singer, hopped a plane on short notice to represent them in person Thursday. 


"If in fact this alligator was being fed, we have real questions about how this could have been allowed to go on," Singer said. He said the gator previously had been targeted for removal, "yet no one on the property who used the lake was told it was there." 


"We are not closing any doors," he said. "Obviously, there are areas that have to be explored." 


Resort officials confirmed Thursday that based on earlier complaints, a trapper had unsuccessfully tried to capture a gator at the resort last Friday. The gator was caught around 10:45 p.m. Wednesday and later destroyed. 


Big Moss Lake, where the Dows were swimming, was closed June 22 because of a high bacteria count. It later reopened. 


Lake Como resort, which opened in 1940 at Leonard and Cot roads, has been a resident-owned co-op since 1997, when the neighbors bought out former owner Kathy Cotterill. 


Resort officials said Wednesday's attack is the first in the park's 60-year history. It came on the heels of an even more tragic attack Saturday in Polk County. 


Two-year-old Alexandria Murphy was found dead near the shoreline of Lake Cannon, the victim of an attack by an alligator that authorities said had been fed and had lost its fear of people. 


Dagmar Dow said Thursday she'll find a new swimming hole when she recovers. 


"Not in the lake," she said. "In the pool, yes. But not in the lake."

Katie asked me to e-mail you this information.

Katie spoke with Jim Loftus at DCA and he spoke with the SBA contact for
Florida this morning.  This gentleman from SBA reiterated to Jim that to
receive SBA monies an area must be declared a disaster area, and no disaster
declaration exists for drought conditions.

The business owners yesterday mentioned that they had been told to fill out
paperwork detailing financial loses for SBA by July 5th.  And from the
information we are getting from SBA they still won't qualify for funds.

Jim Loftus is working with DEP ans SBA to clearify what help will be
available, but I did want to bring this to your attention.

Gov. Bush,
 
I am honored.  Do you have any suggestions concerning how I can be more successful in helping the community?  
 
Please keep abreast of the city of Homestead and their financial health.  The city has major problems.  I am also concerned about Opa-Locka, and two other smaller municipalities.  Almost all the municipalities have co-opted some of Hurricane  Andrew's FEMA money giving them past solvency and the money is now either spent or coming due. 
 
Another problem is small municipalities cannot attract seasoned city managers and it is difficult to recruit qualified financial staff.  The city managers are nice people but not financial fireball's with a thorough understanding of all of a city's financial obligations and there long term ramifications.
 
I thank you again for reading the Watchdog Report.

Timothy J. Keegan community activist and chair of the Biscayne Shores Community Council has 
put forth yet another site for the Florida Marlin's stadium.  The proposed stadium location, not in his community council district, is the former Munisport/Interama.  A 75-acre toxic waste dump, the site is centrally located near Sunny Isles, North Miami Beach and North Miami and is adjacent to Florida International University north campus.
 
Keegan says the plan to have the stadium in the city of Miami is fundamentally flawed and is being driven by political considerations not by attendance and economic factors.  Keegan sees this site as an attractive alternative that takes into consideration the teams existing fan base in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

Governor,
After reviewing your University Trustee appointments thus far, it is very
apparent that the old system (BOR) was a model, which limited the number of
qualified people who could become involved in higher education.  Most of the
appointments are quite remarkable individuals who will only enhance our
system by their active participation.  You've succeeded in breaking up what
amounted to (in the past) an exclusive, white-male dominated club (the BOR)
and creating a richer, more diverse group of citizens, well skilled to
tackle the challenges of advancing higher education for our state.
Congrats!
YHS,
Steve

Governor: 

This is my proposed response to Mr. Clark re: the juvenile prevention issues: 

Dear Mr. Clark: 

Thank you for writing me regarding juvenile-justice prevention programs and my vetoes. Although I did veto some juvenile-prevention spending items, you may be pleased to know that our state budget for next year invests $71.5 million in juvenile prevention, which is 64% higher than just five years ago when our state only provided $43.7 million in juvenile-prevention projects. Regarding the Boys and Girls clubs you mentioned, I approved a $2 million appropriation for those clubs in the education budget. By my actions, Boys and Girls Clubs statewide can continue to provide their valuable services.

I agree with you that it is better to prevent crime than simply punish offenders, although we must do both. Juvenile crime is down in Florida, and we're seeing strong results from my "tough love" initiative which focuses on prevention, intervention and accountability.  Last year alone, juvenile arrests for the most serious crimes dropped 7.1 percent. 

As you know, we must prioritize taxpayer dollars in all government spending. In the area of juvenile prevention programs, the Department of Juvenile Justice has developed an approach that seeks to identify those youth most likely to become repeat or violent offenders. We can then focus our prevention spending on programs that serve these youth.  Before this year's legislative session, my office of Policy and Budget contacted 500 program providers to inform them that we would evaluate juvenile-prevention spending in the budget based on whether the youth served met the following criteria:

1) Significant family problems as evidenced by child abuse or neglect findings, a criminal family member, or a lack of parental supervision and control; 

2) significant problems at school as evidenced by truancy, failing more than one course, or a suspension or expulsion within the last 6 months; 

3) a pattern of substance abuse, including drugs, alcohol or smoking cigarettes; and 
4) pre-delinquent behavior as evidenced by gang membership, chronic running away, a pattern of stealing; or mental health problems associated with delinquent behavior."  

Projects in the budget not meeting these criteria were not approved. This did not mean that vetoed projects were not worthy of private financial contributions or support from local government, but only that they were not appropriately funded in the juvenile-justice budget.  Regarding Suspension With A Purpose, my office spoke with Sheriff Dawsey regarding our process. My office offered to help him next year to seek funding to target those youth most likely to become repeat or violent juvenile offenders. 

Thank you again for writing. I regret that you are disappointed by some of my budget actions, but I hope this information provides some clarification as to our goal to use  state taxpayer dollars in the most efficient manner.

Gov. Jeb, 

With your recent rejection of funding for various youth programs 
to include Boys & Girls Clubs, Suspension With A Purpose and others 
it appears to me you are being "penny wise and pound foolish". 
Failing to fund these programs now will only end up costing us more 
later in Judicial, Incarceration and Police expenses, lots more. 
It is a lot less expensive to build a Youth facility than a Jail not 
to mention the Police/Sheriff station and courthouse that need to be 
built or expanded along with the jail. This makes no sense to me unless 
one of your hidden goals is to continue to create Gov't Sprawl and 
ultimately a Police State. 

I also question your cancelling of funding for alternative energy 
research along with many of your other decisions and reversals from 
campaign statements. 

It appears to me that my supporting you for election and voting for 
you was a mistake as your actions speak differently than your words. 
This is a mistake I will not repeat if your actions continue down 
these paths. I am not a sit at home, keep my mouth shut voter so 
take note that my concerns and impressions will not rest in the 
shade.

Jeb,  
 
I don’t know if you have been following Pasco County news, but even our animals act like they are possessed…  A river otter, in a body of water in a subdivision (close to my grandson Gavin’s elementary school, in fact) grabs a dog by the nose and drowns it…. An alligator attacks a woman swimming at a nudist colony in Land O’ Lakes… 
 
I’ve decided that the most dangerous animals of all, however, are people who govern themselves according to politics, and not principles.  The “p.s.” below is from a message I sent earlier in the week to someone who seems quite principled.”  
 
Kim
 
p.s. It seems fitting at this juncture to point out that we live in black bear country: the tiny sliver of green on the west coast, next to the logo for I-75 encompasses our home, albeit we are only about ¼ mile in from U.S. 19.  It has always made me feel somewhat hopeful that the governor is in black bear country too, although I am not sure why.  Sometimes I think he’ll get the bear, sometimes I think the bear will get him.  (Sometimes I wonder if he is the bear).  We’ll see.

Mr. Jeb Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
Tallahassee, FL
 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
Dear Mr. Bush:
 
The 21st century education delivery system will surely lead the nation in K-20 education governance reform. The independent sector has mirrored the Governor’s goals for education and strongly believes that the Division of Independent Education will be a key-element in the new governance structure. We, at Florida Christian University, believe on that and also understand that Dr. C. Wayne Freeberg should be appointed as the Executive Director of Division of Independent Education.
 
The caring, commitment, collaboration, and leadership that Dr. Freeberg has dedicated to the development of the independent education sector in Florida, firmly indicates that he will achieve even greater accomplishments as the Executive Director of Division of Independent Education.
 
Florida Christian University is an educational institution established in 1985, in the State of Florida. Nowadays we are present in more than 50 countries, and we have more than 1,000 students all around the world. We really hope you will provide the opportunity for continuing to count on the seamless collaboration of Dr. Freeberg.
 
May God bless you.
 
Sincerely,
 
Anthony B. Portigliatti

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing in strong support of Emily Fritz's application to fill the current
commissioner vacancy on the Leon County Board of County
Commissioners. I am a resident of Leon County, a registered republican,
and supported your successful campaign for governor.

More importantly, I know Emily Fritz, the needs of our current County
Commission, and many of the critical needs of our county.  I believe Emily
is uniquely qualified to fill the vacancy and help address many of our
needs.

Emily is intelligent, capable of quickly researching and assessing issues,
setting priorities and is an excellent listener.  More importantly, Emily is
balanced, respectful, and consistent.  I also have no doubt that Emily's
decisions on the commission would be based upon the good of the
county as opposed to any future political ambitions.

We often hear how our current political process discourages the best
individuals in our communities from entering politics.  I truly believe Emily
Fritz is an example of one of those people who cares deeply about her
community, wants to see it overcome its financial and leadership
challenges, and wants to help it set a course for a bright and prosperous
future.  

However if it were not for this unique form of appointment, I do not
believe Emily would be willing to expose herself to the personal attacks
so common in political campaigns.

You have an excellent opportunity to help shape the future of Leon
County. I urge you to appoint a person whose only interest is to
effectively serve the people of Leon County.  Emily Fritz will not
disappoint you. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush,
	I am a business associate and friend of Emily Fritz and want to 
recommend that you appoint her to fill the vacancy on the Leon County 
Commission. As you know Emily is the Director of Citizens' Services for 
your office as Governor of Florida and was the co-chairperson for your 
campaign for governor. I've known Emily nearly four years after meeting 
her while she was a participant in the Leadership Tallahassee program 
sponsored by the Tallahassee Area chamber of Commerce. As a former 
Leadership Tallahassee participant and former member of the Leadership 
Tallahassee Board of Governors I personally observed Emily's enthusiasm 
and dedication during the year she participated in that program. I am 
also familiar with her active involvement with the Junior League and 
the Friends of the Library. She has made numerous contributions to the 
Tallahassee and Leon County areas. Her interest in this community along 
with her enthusiasm and dedication to any mission she is involved with 
makes her an excellent candidate for a position on the Leon county 
Commission. I heartily recommend you appoint Emily to fill the current 
vacancy on that commission.

Subject: Healthy Kids Board Meeting



Governor: As you know the Healthy Kids Board of Directors met this afternoon to deal with several issues, one of which was the local match question.  The Board's legal counsel agreed (in writing) that the case which will be filed regarding the unconstitutionality of the proviso language has merit.  He recommended, and the Board proceeded to discuss, the local match issue in anticipation of the court's ruling.  Dr. Steve Friedman made a motion that the Board policy be the one that was adopted earlier this year (as a recommendation to the legislature).  In essence, this was a multi-year proposal that:

- Each county have an allotment of "base slots" for which no local contribution is required.  Base slots should be assigned using three tiers, based upon the number of children 19 years and younger in that county.  Smaller counties would have 500 base slots, medium counties 750 base slots, and larger counties 1,000 base slots.

- Counties would have the ability to voluntarily decide whether to expand coverage for children in their county above the number of available slots.

- For those counties voluntarily deciding to expand coverage above the base slots, the local match contribution would be structured in a three-tier fashion, that is based on a county's economic base.  "Available, objective measures should be used to assign counties to one of the three tiers; for example, county volume of taxable sales receipts is one measure that could be used".

- A three year shedule for implementating the voluntary local match contribution based on a county's economic base was recommended.  By year three, the recommended percentage of local match contribution for each child enrolled over the assigned base slots is two percent for counties with the lowest economic base, six percent for counties with a moderate base, and ten percent for counties with the highest economic base.  (In year one- presumably 2001-2002 if we prevail in the court case, the three tiers will be 5%, 10%, and 15%.  In other words, no county will pay more than the state government does toward the total non-federal cost of 30% per child.  Those counties who are currently at 20%, would drop to at least 15%- or lower if they have a smaller economic base, etc).

I made a motion that amended the above to: "only pertain to that portion of the Board's previous recommendations that occur in year one   The motion as I amended it was adopted 7 to 1.  For the motion:  Me, (John Agwunobi and Mike Hightower through proxy to me), Les Abberger, Kenny Shipley, Steve Friedman, and Pete Mitchell.  Dr. St. Petery voted against this and adamantly argued to remove local match altogether.  The Board's action will therefore pertain only to this year.  It sustains the federal-state-local nature of this program, and it decreases (although probably not eliminating) some of the fiscal differences between counties.  If/when implemented, it will decrease local match contribution for this next year from $ 11.8 million (collected this year), to $ 7.1 million in FY 2001-2002.

I have reviewed this with Mike Hansen after the meeting, and will be glad to brief you further on it as needed.

Dear Governor:

As you know, I recommended to you that you nominate Hugo Menendez to fill
the School Board seat vacated by Demetrio Perez.  I believe that Hugo is
eminently qualified and has the strength of character, the ethics and the
experience to help clean the problems which plague the system.

Hugo's selection would send a clear signal that things need to change.  It
would be a departure from the more politically inclined nominees, but I
believe that is exactly what we need.  Hugo is also an educator to boot.
You know how concerned I have been with the ethical lapses that have tarred
our image.  The School system is too important.  Education is your number 1
priority.

However, I have heard that you are seriously considering Frank Bolanos.  I
have known Frank for a very long time, and I believe he has high ethical
standards and is deeply committed to work hard to shape things up.

While I believe Hugo to be the outstanding candidate, choosing Frank will
also be an excellent choice.

Best regards, and as always, you can count on my support

I am sorry that you are disappointed with my response. Yes, this is me. Your inside sources are wrong about responses of emails sent to this email address. Of course you can volunteer your efforts. I am sorry Commissioner Crist did not connect you with the right folks. I will ask Kim McDougal of my staff to contact you directly.

What a shame....
I realize that this and my previous E-mail did not go directly to the Governor. I understand from inside sources that several people are responsible for the responses that we average citizens get from this E address. But, I was hoping that this avenue would enable me to move forward with my desire to serve the people of my community and state.
It's been almost 3 months since this original correspondence and I am still waiting for some kind of direction. Commissioner Crist's office sent me a nice note, but nothing since. I have attended 2 separate functions recently that both the Governor and Lt. Governor were at as well. I heard them speak about children needing safe learning environments, but I don't understand why someone like me is not being offered the opportunity to volunteer my efforts.
While I agree that Resource Officers are needed to combat this problem, I think parent involvement may be even more crucial. Wouldn't it be better if we addressed the real issues of violent youths instead of standing prepared with a bandaid
when the situation explodes onto our campuses? Schools cannot begin to teach literacy skills to Little Johnny while he is concerned about getting shot in the hall. Parents must be a part of the answer.
The response I got from my original E-mail led me to believe that I had connected with the right offices/people. I was fired up and ready to go.... what happened?

Roxanna, thank you for your email. The state is proactive in its approach to school safety issues but there is more that we can do. 
 
My personal belief is that we should expand the school resource officer concept as the first, best way to deal with school violence. The use of police officers in schools is the ultimate form of community policing. HOtlines, counseling, prevention education, assessment activities are being done throughout the state. Again, we should always strive to do better.
 
I am passing on your email to Commissioner Charlie Crist so that he can get you involved in the safety efforts in some way. Charlie is a leader in this policy area.
 
Jeb Bush

As a multi-generation Floridian who is proud of her heritage, and our state, I write to you with a heavy heart for our children.
Last school year, there were more than 180,000 reports of crime and violence in Florida schools. My own personal experience has been at a High School where we lost a student to gun violence in our student parking lot. Our usually quiet community was rocked and still bears the scars of lost innocence and security shaken. 
I am proud to say that as a school family, we are healing and moving on. However, our own tragic experience and the reported numbers tell us that we must be pro-active in preventing the kind of pain that our community endured.
What steps are being taken through your office to address today's school safety issues? Having lived the nightmare, it is important to me to know that we are moving in a direction that will facilitate safe learning environments for the children of our state. I also ask not only what your office is doing, but what can I personally do to be a part of the solution. I believe that ultimately, my unsolicited education with our own crisis happened in my life for a reason. I would welcome the opportunity to be a constructive force in providing my own children and others the means to attend school without fear.
                                         Respectfully,
                                         Roxanna M. Torre

SECTION: State and Regional 

LENGTH: 637 words 

HEADLINE: Comptroller says agency needs to tighten business practices 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

BODY: 
The state's economic development agency, which touts itself as an example
for the way to run a business, needs to do a better job keeping track of its
own expenses and procedures for selecting contracts, a state audit said. 

The 52-page report also said Enterprise Florida Inc., treats its top
executives to bonuses and lavish travel while making grants to businesses
whose officers sit on its boards. 

Comptroller Bob Milligan's auditors said EFI officials set up a $2.4 million
private bank account to cover exclusive club memberships, lobbying expenses
and extra pay for leaders of the Orlando-based operation. 

Since Enterprise Florida is required to match state money with private
corporate funds, the auditors said there is no way of knowing whether
companies getting grants from the partnership recycled some of the cash into
the perks pot. 

"We recommend that EFI establish a policy that requires all moneys received
be deposited in the master bank account," said the auditors. 

Enterprise Florida has until July 13 to respond to the preliminary audit
draft. 

A spokesman for EFI, Roger Pynn, told the Tallahassee Democrat in a story
published Thursday that the auditor's questions "are about records,
processes and paper work," not money. 

He said audit criticisms will be resolved point by point and involved only a
tiny fraction of EFI's $45 million in grants to businesses over the past two
years. 

In many cases, auditors said, EFI had only a company's word that the
taxpayers and corporate investors got a good deal for a grant or service
contract. 

"We recommend that EFI follow their own policies and procedures and document
the methodology in selecting contracts," the report said. 

Pynn said the private account was set up to do things the old Commerce
Department, as a state agency, could not do, like entertaining business
prospects in a luxury stadium box at New York Yankee games, picking up
travel tabs for EFI chief John Anderson and his wife in Europe, and paying
entertainment expenses at board meetings and sales conferences around the
world. 

"It's called a private bank account because it's private money," Pynn said
of the executive fund. "It's designed to cover expenses that need to be done
in the private arena." 

But the audit said there appeared to be some "recycling" of money between
EFI and private companies that match the state's funds for business
development. 

"Our audit noted several instances where grantees were providing funding to
the private bank account as a means of participating in EFI trade-sponsored
events," said the draft report. "This creates a situation where state
funding may be used for unauthorized purposes such as to pay lobbyists,
provide political club membership fees and EFI salary adjustments." 

Names of companies receiving EFI grants and contracts were removed from the
audit draft. The newspaper obtained the auditors' working papers, which
included the names, under state open records laws. 

Enterprise Florida was created in 1996 when then-Gov. Lawton Chiles
abolished the Department of Commerce. Gov. Jeb Bush also supports the
privatization concept and has an EFI trade mission to Brazil scheduled next
month. 

EFI is a partnership among the state and private businesses. Its main state
funding comes from the Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development,
but the Department of Community Affairs also contributes. 

Among EFI's major private supporters are Sun Trust, Walt Disney World,
BellSouth, Lockheed Martin, Tupperware, the St. Joe Co., Darden Restaurants,
First Union, Sprint and Tampa Electric Co. 

Jessica Cary, EFI's communications director in Tallahassee, said the
partnership was credited with creating 35,000 new jobs last fiscal year and
increasing export sales by more than $335 million.

My dear Governor Bush:
 
It has been my privilege to minister to prisoners through a program entitled "Kairos."  My first encounter as a "Godparent" there was with a young man named Michael Garner (VO4349).  I was struck by his complete candor, honesty, and his past responsibilities to his work, his family and his good citizenship.  He has a wife and two young children, and they are intensely loyal in visiting every week-end, and appear to be a very loving family.  
 
It is my understanding that Michael has been in the Kairos program for about 1-1/2 years now, and these past six months has been promoted to the title of "Encourager," which means he is responsible for stimulating the other inmates to become better God-fearing men who will become responsible citizens upon their release, or, in the case that there is no hope of release, that they graduate from the program and teach others what they have learned about anger control, responsibility to our neighbor, and to learn to trust in one another AND most of all, in God.  This man is a real example to others, and I have reason to believe that he is not responsible for what put him behind bars, since it was apparently due to a reaction to prescription medication which caused a complete change in his rational thinking and behavior.  
 
If you would only give this beautiful young man a chance by interceding for him,  I am sure you would be taking the only conscienable action that can be done.  Please accept my sincere thanks for your looking into this matter.  He is not a rich man, but he tells me even his church has had a drive to raise enough money to pay for legal fees to go forward on his behalf.   I believe in you, Mr. Bush, and in your family.  I know you to be a fair and honest governor.  I voted for you because of that, and am counting on you to keep up the good work you have been doing for our State of Florida.  Please look into the Kairos program - it is a world wide program promoting Christian values and we find the recidivism rate is unbelievable in those who graduate from the program.
 
Thank you.

community for many years.  She has supported organizations from the American 
Cancer Society, Mary Brogan Museum, Junior League, and the Red Cross.

I believe she will supply a broad range of community contacts as well as 
true community needs.

Subject: A child with a new heart needs help 


Governor Jeb Bush 

We apologize for reaching you like this, however we have an emergency 
situation and Mary Collins was kind enough to provide us with a direct 
contact to you. 

I would like to bring to your attention the situation of this young child 
who is fighting for his life. 

Abel Valencia is a very unfortunate 13 year old from Colombia who came to 
our attention in March 1999 following a syncopal episode.  A thorough 
investigation showed that he had Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve, 
which caused a severe impairment of the function of the right ventricle 
causing severe heart failure.  He underwent right atrial reduction and 
tricuspid valvuloplasty in 1999, but soon after surgery he rapidly developed 
again worsening of heart failure and ascites with a protein-loosing 
enteropathy.  Since then, his condition has been gradually deteriorating. 

In May 2001 he had two strokes and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation 
and he had some thrombi in the heart.  He has also developed thrombosis of 
the radial artery.  After appropriate anticoagulation, he underwent again 
open heart surgery to try to improve his condition. 

After surgery, he had a persistent bleeding and he was required to be taken 
back to the operating room where he experienced a prolonged cardiac arrest 
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and because of the poor cardiac 
function he was placed on a mechanical pump. 

Abel today underwent orthotopic heart transplant, which was the only option 
to keep him alive.  He is currently in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, at 
Jackson Memorial Hospital. 

Abel will require long term medical care and medications to prevent the 
rejection of his new heart.  The initial applications to the Children's 
Medical Service and Florida Medicaid were rejected because of the lack of 
immigration papers.  I kindly ask if there is any way that we can help this 
unfortunate child, who has already been through so much at this young age. 

Thank you for your immediate assistance to this matter. Please feel free to 
contact me for any further information. 


Sincerely yours,

HEADLINE: Comptroller says agency needs to tighten business practices 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

BODY: 
The state's economic development agency, which touts itself as an example
for the way to run a business, needs to do a better job keeping track of its
own expenses and procedures for selecting contracts, a state audit said. 

The 52-page report also said Enterprise Florida Inc., treats its top
executives to bonuses and lavish travel while making grants to businesses
whose officers sit on its boards. 

Comptroller Bob Milligan's auditors said EFI officials set up a $2.4 million
private bank account to cover exclusive club memberships, lobbying expenses
and extra pay for leaders of the Orlando-based operation. 

Since Enterprise Florida is required to match state money with private
corporate funds, the auditors said there is no way of knowing whether
companies getting grants from the partnership recycled some of the cash into
the perks pot. 

"We recommend that EFI establish a policy that requires all moneys received
be deposited in the master bank account," said the auditors. 

Enterprise Florida has until July 13 to respond to the preliminary audit
draft. 

A spokesman for EFI, Roger Pynn, told the Tallahassee Democrat in a story
published Thursday that the auditor's questions "are about records,
processes and paper work," not money. 

He said audit criticisms will be resolved point by point and involved only a
tiny fraction of EFI's $45 million in grants to businesses over the past two
years. 

In many cases, auditors said, EFI had only a company's word that the
taxpayers and corporate investors got a good deal for a grant or service
contract. 

"We recommend that EFI follow their own policies and procedures and document
the methodology in selecting contracts," the report said. 

Pynn said the private account was set up to do things the old Commerce
Department, as a state agency, could not do, like entertaining business
prospects in a luxury stadium box at New York Yankee games, picking up
travel tabs for EFI chief John Anderson and his wife in Europe, and paying
entertainment expenses at board meetings and sales conferences around the
world. 

"It's called a private bank account because it's private money," Pynn said
of the executive fund. "It's designed to cover expenses that need to be done
in the private arena." 

But the audit said there appeared to be some "recycling" of money between
EFI and private companies that match the state's funds for business
development. 

"Our audit noted several instances where grantees were providing funding to
the private bank account as a means of participating in EFI trade-sponsored
events," said the draft report. "This creates a situation where state
funding may be used for unauthorized purposes such as to pay lobbyists,
provide political club membership fees and EFI salary adjustments." 

Names of companies receiving EFI grants and contracts were removed from the
audit draft. The newspaper obtained the auditors' working papers, which
included the names, under state open records laws. 

Enterprise Florida was created in 1996 when then-Gov. Lawton Chiles
abolished the Department of Commerce. Gov. Jeb Bush also supports the
privatization concept and has an EFI trade mission to Brazil scheduled next
month. 

EFI is a partnership among the state and private businesses. Its main state
funding comes from the Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development,
but the Department of Community Affairs also contributes. 

Among EFI's major private supporters are Sun Trust, Walt Disney World,
BellSouth, Lockheed Martin, Tupperware, the St. Joe Co., Darden Restaurants,
First Union, Sprint and Tampa Electric Co. 

Jessica Cary, EFI's communications director in Tallahassee, said the
partnership was credited with creating 35,000 new jobs last fiscal year and
increasing export sales by more than $335 million.

Patriotic veteran fined for flagpole violation 
An Associated Press report

WEST PALM BEACH - A patriotic Jupiter resident said he was willing to go to 
jail for flying an American flag from a 12-foot pole in his front yard, a 
violation of his homeowners association and a court order. 

But instead of jail time, a judge Wednesday ordered George Andres, a Korean 
War veteran, to pay $100 for each day the pole was planted outside his town 
house since she ordered him to take it down in October. 

Andres could have faced up to 90 days in jail for contempt of court, 
according to his attorney, Brook Fisher. 

The Indian Creek Phase 3B Homeowners Association permits flags flown only 
from wall brackets attached to the homes. It says 17 homeowners have chosen 
to raise American flags that way. 

But Andres, a former Marine and retired electrician, says he has a 
constitutional right to fly the flag from the pole. 

``If you can burn a flag, you have no problem,'' he said. ``So, if you can 
burn a flag, why can't you fly the flag?'' 

He also contends he would be desecrating the flag by flying it from the 
brackets because it would touch the bushes in his yard. 

The association sued Andres over the flagpole, and a state court agreed with 
it in October. 

Circuit Judge Catherine Brunson ruled that the association's restriction 
didn't infringe on Andres' rights. An appeals court earlier this month upheld 
Brunson's ruling. 

But the two sides were back in Brunson's West Palm Beach courtroom this week 
after the association said it had photos and a calendar to show that Andres 
had flown the flag 73 days since the Oct. 27 ruling, which would cost him 
$7,300. 

Andres argued that he flew the flag only on federal holidays. 

The association's attorney, Steven Selz, said the issue isn't about the flag, 
but the pole, which hurts the neighborhood's appearance. 

``I know he's a patriotic guy,'' Selz said. ``But he has to follow the rules 
like everybody else.''

Subject: Michael Garner, Incarcerated at Tomoka Correctional Institution


My dear Governor Bush:
 
It has been my privilege to minister to prisoners through a program entitled "Kairos."  My first encounter as a "Godparent" there was with a young man named Michael Garner (VO4349).  I was struck by his complete candor, honesty, and his past responsibilities to his work, his family and his good citizenship.  He has a wife and two young children, and they are intensely loyal in visiting every week-end, and appear to be a very loving family.  
 
It is my understanding that Michael has been in the Kairos program for about 1-1/2 years now, and these past six months has been promoted to the title of "Encourager," which means he is responsible for stimulating the other inmates to become better God-fearing men who will become responsible citizens upon their release, or, in the case that there is no hope of release, that they graduate from the program and teach others what they have learned about anger control, responsibility to our neighbor, and to learn to trust in one another AND most of all, in God.  This man is a real example to others, and I have reason to believe that he is not responsible for what put him behind bars, since it was apparently due to a reaction to prescription medication which caused a complete change in his rational thinking and behavior.  
 
If you would only give this beautiful young man a chance by interceding for him,  I am sure you would be taking the only conscienable action that can be done.  Please accept my sincere thanks for your looking into this matter.  He is not a rich man, but he tells me even his church has had a drive to raise enough money to pay for legal fees to go forward on his behalf.   I believe in you, Mr. Bush, and in your family.  I know you to be a fair and honest governor.  I voted for you because of that, and am counting on you to keep up the good work you have been doing for our State of Florida.  Please look into the Kairos program - it is a world wide program promoting Christian values and we find the recidivism rate is unbelievable in those who graduate from the program.
 
Thank you.

	Eli Ferrera called me prior to the announcement of the appointment of the trustees for the Florida State University.  First, how extremely thoughtful that someone as busy as you and she would arrange for such personal contact to those of us who applied but who were not appointed.  That thoughtfulness is appreciated deeply.  Thank you .

	Second, the Florida State University because of its unique 150 year academic history and accomplishment is best suited of all of our public universities as the basis of the order of things to diversify Florida's economy by liberating Florida from its longtime substantial reliance on exploitation of it physical assets.  California, Texas and North Carolina liberated themselves from similar approaches 50 years ago; but not yet Florida.  The trustees you appoint to such a statewide and even international asset as the Florida State University will be critical to diversify our economy.  The liberal arts and basic science amalgam at Florida State upon which its research, professional training and public service traditions are based, are the basis of the order of things for the next 50 years in Florida by which we diversify our economy.  Any objective comparisons of Florida State's academic strengths with the three or four most fundamental challenges we face leads to an understanding of how crucial Florida State is to a new intellect-based economy.  You are Governor who seems to understand.  Thanks.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to recommend William L. (Bill) Moor Jr. for appointment to
the Leon County Commission.  Bill is a lifetime resident of Tallahassee
who has demonstrated tremendous commitment to our community and our
state.  As you will see from his resume and application, he has held
leadership roles in numerous organizations and has given freely of his
time to make Tallahassee a better place to live, work and raise a
family.  Bill is interested in this position because he wants to
continue to work hard for Tallahassee and Leon County.  

This appointment is critical to the future of Florida's Capital City.
We have worked hard to overcome our reputation as a county that is
unfriendly to business.  We need a business-minded person like Bill Moor
on the Commission.  Bill will hear all sides, weigh the evidence and
vote - not with the crowd - but, he will vote for what he believes in
best.  I would appreciate your favorable consideration of his
application.

Dear Governor Bush,
	I am a business associate and friend of Emily Fritz and want to 
recommend that you appoint her to fill the vacancy on the Leon County 
Commission. As you know Emily is the Director of Citizens' Services for 
your office as Governor of Florida and was the co-chairperson for your 
campaign for governor. I've known Emily nearly four years after meeting 
her while she was a participant in the Leadership Tallahassee program 
sponsored by the Tallahassee Area chamber of Commerce. As a former 
Leadership Tallahassee participant and former member of the Leadership 
Tallahassee Board of Governors I personally observed Emily's enthusiasm 
and dedication during the year she participated in that program. I am 
also familiar with her active involvement with the Junior League and 
the Friends of the Library. She has made numerous contributions to the 
Tallahassee and Leon County areas. Her interest in this community along 
with her enthusiasm and dedication to any mission she is involved with 
makes her an excellent candidate for a position on the Leon county 
Commission. I heartily recommend you appoint Emily to fill the current 
vacancy on that commission.

Subject:	Appointment to Leon County Board of County Commissioners

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing in strong support of Emily Fritz's application to fill the current
commissioner vacancy on the Leon County Board of County
Commissioners. I am a resident of Leon County, a registered republican,
and supported your successful campaign for governor.

More importantly, I know Emily Fritz, the needs of our current County
Commission, and many of the critical needs of our county.  I believe Emily
is uniquely qualified to fill the vacancy and help address many of our
needs.

Emily is intelligent, capable of quickly researching and assessing issues,
setting priorities and is an excellent listener.  More importantly, Emily is
balanced, respectful, and consistent.  I also have no doubt that Emily's
decisions on the commission would be based upon the good of the
county as opposed to any future political ambitions.

We often hear how our current political process discourages the best
individuals in our communities from entering politics.  I truly believe Emily
Fritz is an example of one of those people who cares deeply about her
community, wants to see it overcome its financial and leadership
challenges, and wants to help it set a course for a bright and prosperous
future.  

However if it were not for this unique form of appointment, I do not
believe Emily would be willing to expose herself to the personal attacks
so common in political campaigns.

You have an excellent opportunity to help shape the future of Leon
County. I urge you to appoint a person whose only interest is to
effectively serve the people of Leon County.  Emily Fritz will not
disappoint you. 

Thank you for your consideration.

	Eli Ferrera called me prior to the announcement of the appointment of the trustees for the Florida State University.  First, how extremely thoughtful that someone as busy as you and she would arrange for such personal contact to those of us who applied but who were not appointed.  That thoughtfulness is appreciated deeply.  Thank you .

	Second, the Florida State University because of its unique 150 year academic history and accomplishment is best suited of all of our public universities as the basis of the order of things to diversify Florida's economy by liberating Florida from its longtime substantial reliance on exploitation of it physical assets.  California, Texas and North Carolina liberated themselves from similar approaches 50 years ago; but not yet Florida.  The trustees you appoint to such a statewide and even international asset as the Florida State University will be critical to diversify our economy.  The liberal arts and basic science amalgam at Florida State upon which its research, professional training and public service traditions are based, are the basis of the order of things for the next 50 years in Florida by which we diversify our economy.  Any objective comparisons of Florida State's academic strengths with the three or four most fundamental challenges we face leads to an understanding of how crucial Florida State is to a new intellect-based economy.  You are Governor who seems to understand.  Thanks.

Patriotic veteran fined for flagpole violation 
An Associated Press report

WEST PALM BEACH - A patriotic Jupiter resident said he was willing to go to 
jail for flying an American flag from a 12-foot pole in his front yard, a 
violation of his homeowners association and a court order. 

But instead of jail time, a judge Wednesday ordered George Andres, a Korean 
War veteran, to pay $100 for each day the pole was planted outside his town 
house since she ordered him to take it down in October. 

Andres could have faced up to 90 days in jail for contempt of court, 
according to his attorney, Brook Fisher. 

The Indian Creek Phase 3B Homeowners Association permits flags flown only 
from wall brackets attached to the homes. It says 17 homeowners have chosen 
to raise American flags that way. 

But Andres, a former Marine and retired electrician, says he has a 
constitutional right to fly the flag from the pole. 

``If you can burn a flag, you have no problem,'' he said. ``So, if you can 
burn a flag, why can't you fly the flag?'' 

He also contends he would be desecrating the flag by flying it from the 
brackets because it would touch the bushes in his yard. 

The association sued Andres over the flagpole, and a state court agreed with 
it in October. 

Circuit Judge Catherine Brunson ruled that the association's restriction 
didn't infringe on Andres' rights. An appeals court earlier this month upheld 
Brunson's ruling. 

But the two sides were back in Brunson's West Palm Beach courtroom this week 
after the association said it had photos and a calendar to show that Andres 
had flown the flag 73 days since the Oct. 27 ruling, which would cost him 
$7,300. 

Andres argued that he flew the flag only on federal holidays. 

The association's attorney, Steven Selz, said the issue isn't about the flag, 
but the pole, which hurts the neighborhood's appearance. 

``I know he's a patriotic guy,'' Selz said. ``But he has to follow the rules 
like everybody else.''

Subject:	RE: Healthy Kids

Mike and I spoke yesterday, and Mike, Donna and I spoke this morning.  The
next meeting is today.  We have the votes (Mike spoke to them) to keep local
match.  Caveat:  the board is strongly inclined to make local match
equitable (even funding levels across all counties, with exceptions for
rural and low-income counties, which would get a certain number of "free"
slots).  Based on several comments you've made to staff, Donna and Mike tell
me that you feel the same way about local match - that it needs to be more
equitable.  Now, to make the contributions more equitable and keep the same
funding level, you'd have to make some counties pay more and others less and
balance out at the old level (11-something million).  Dr. Brooks proposed
this last year and lost resoundingly; he moved to reconsider and lost again.
So the strong sentiment on the board is to make funding more equitable by
reducing what some counties pay, but not raising any county's contribution;
the result is a net loss.  Today's proposal thus reduces local match from
11-something million to 7-something million.  But the bottom line is that
local match is kept.  We are talking to board members to encourage them not
to reduce it any further in out-years; there was some talk about reducing it
further to 6, and then 5 in the out-years.  We are lobbying members to keep
this a one-year proposal that can be revisited next year.

Schools knuckle down for cuts 
MARILYN BROWN of The Tampa Tribune

Students and teachers will feel the effects of staff cuts ordered this week 
in schools across Hillsborough County, but the superintendent said Wednesday 
he has little choice. 

Facing higher costs, including some that remain unknown, Superintendent Earl 
Lennard has told school principals to cut their staff budgets by 2 percent 
for the academic year ahead. 

The $16.2 million pot of money generated will be a trade-off, Lennard said. 
It will help increase salaries and benefits to recruit and retain teachers, 
but schools will have fewer nonteaching staff to help out. 

Hillsborough is acting for several reasons, Lennard said. It needs to 
squirrel money away for increased health insurance and other costs. Its state 
funding this year, while higher than expected, came with more restrictions 
than usual. And a state law effective July 1 requires newly hired teachers to 
be paid for all experience in other states or school districts. 

That law, designed to recruit teachers, could lead to demands for retroactive 
compensation among those already on the payroll, officials statewide fear. 
Some teachers even may try to become new hires in neighboring districts. 

``How many people will wait until July 1 to jump districts, we don't know,'' 
said Richard Martinez, Hillsborough's general director for employee 
relations. 

In the meantime, principals have until today to figure out how to cut 2 
percent. 

It may not be too hard, Lennard suggested; many nonteaching vacancies ``we 
couldn't fill anyway.'' What's more, he said: ``I would rather have the best 
teaching staff in the state of Florida than the best in other areas. Toilets 
are still going to flush, and the clerical work will still get done.'' 

But some principals said the cuts could mean some classrooms get more 
students, and some students get less personal attention. 

``It will hurt,'' said Faye Pages, principal of Lake Magdalene Elementary 
School. ``In elementary schools we are already very tight with units.'' 

To cut 1.2 ``units'' from her staff, Pages is dropping two exceptional 
education staff worth a half-unit each and a once-weekly employee who helps a 
speech therapist with paperwork. 

``The speech therapist will have less time with children because of the extra 
paperwork,'' Pages said. A teacher of a regular class that includes some 
emotionally disabled students will be without the help of an aide. 

High schools should be hit less hard, said Wharton High Principal Mitch 
Muley, because they can disperse a class of students or drop a course to 
reduce the load of teachers who take on extra classes. 

``We're just doing things differently,'' said Muley, who had hired most of 
the new teachers he needed before Lennard temporarily froze teacher hiring 
last week to await the repercussions of the staff cuts. 

Muley pared 3.5 units, also dropping exceptional education aides and 
rescheduling some bilingual and remediation help to an after-school program. 

Hillsborough expects to gain $7.7 million from additional changes, which 
include elimination of a top administrative post held by retiring John Owens, 
said Jim Hamilton, deputy superintendent for operations. Some vacant clerical 
jobs won't be filled, he said, and about 18 in the maintenance department 
will be combined or erased. 

The efforts, which began last fall, should redirect money to classrooms and 
give schools more responsibility for their budgets, Hamilton said. 

``No one should lose their job,'' he said. ``We're letting the schools 
decide. If they have a teacher vacancy, they may consider combining some 
classes. Or they may train a media specialist to share the work of a 
technology specialist.'' 

Amid a national shortage, he noted, there should be plenty of jobs in 
Hillsborough for any teachers cut. 

Hillsborough, like other districts in Florida, is trying to improve its 
teacher recruitment and retention with better pay and benefits. Florida 
traditionally has paid less than many states and has failed to give full 
credit for experience. 

Hillsborough currently pays for up to seven years of experience outside the 
district. Had it fully compensated the 122 teachers who exceeded that limit 
when they were hired last year, for example, it would have spent another 
$500,000, Martinez said. To compensate the scores of veteran employees who 
never got full credit could cost another $3 million, he said. 

It will be left to districts to negotiate with teacher unions to satisfy 
those employees. Hillsborough is doing that, Martinez said, and may try to 
``catch up'' those teachers over several years. 

Wayne Blanton, director of the Florida School Boards Association, said other 
districts are taking a similar approach. He is not sure how many teachers 
might try to switch districts. 

``We have to go through a year and see. We're asking districts to keep 
track,'' he said. 

Blanton's organization sponsored a teacher recruitment and retention task 
force this year that pushed for the full-credit idea. 

``It's still a good idea,'' he said. ``It was never our intention to accept 
it without the funding.''

My dear Governor Bush:
 
It has been my privilege to minister to prisoners through a program entitled "Kairos."  My first encounter as a "Godparent" there was with a young man named Michael Garner (VO4349).  I was struck by his complete candor, honesty, and his past responsibilities to his work, his family and his good citizenship.  He has a wife and two young children, and they are intensely loyal in visiting every week-end, and appear to be a very loving family.  
 
It is my understanding that Michael has been in the Kairos program for about 1-1/2 years now, and these past six months has been promoted to the title of "Encourager," which means he is responsible for stimulating the other inmates to become better God-fearing men who will become responsible citizens upon their release, or, in the case that there is no hope of release, that they graduate from the program and teach others what they have learned about anger control, responsibility to our neighbor, and to learn to trust in one another AND most of all, in God.  This man is a real example to others, and I have reason to believe that he is not responsible for what put him behind bars, since it was apparently due to a reaction to prescription medication which caused a complete change in his rational thinking and behavior.  
 
If you would only give this beautiful young man a chance by interceding for him,  I am sure you would be taking the only conscienable action that can be done.  Please accept my sincere thanks for your looking into this matter.  He is not a rich man, but he tells me even his church has had a drive to raise enough money to pay for legal fees to go forward on his behalf.   I believe in you, Mr. Bush, and in your family.  I know you to be a fair and honest governor.  I voted for you because of that, and am counting on you to keep up the good work you have been doing for our State of Florida.  Please look into the Kairos program - it is a world wide program promoting Christian values and we find the recidivism rate is unbelievable in those who graduate from the program.
 
Thank you.

Re:  Your Memo of February 5, 2001 to Dr. Phil Marty
 
Dear Ms. Segrest:
 
In your February 5, 2001 memorandum to Dr. Phil Marty, you gave advice to him which he did not follow in writing his letter of counsel to me, dated February 8, 2001.  Moreover, he withheld your memo from me, and I did not see it until an hour or so prior to meeting with you and attorney R. B. Friedlander in your office on or about March 22, 2001.  You may recall my discussing my concerns about this with you at that time.  Your memo was vital information that I needed to make an informed decision about how to respond to Dr. Marty’s letter, which in any event, I immediately recognized as lacking legal efficacy: his withholding it was a terrorist tactic, such as I have seen too often before, including from him.  
 
It is now abundantly apparent that an unlawful termination of my employment was where the University was headed all along, especially inasmuch as the University had countless other options and did not pursue them.  If the University held me in as high regard as has been claimed all along, there is no way anyone at the University would have so much as mistreated me, let alone, unlawful lock me out (wrongly called a termination).  Moreover, the University’s agents – including at least Dr. Marty, Dr. Mahan, 
Dr. Gulitz, Dr. Daugherty and Ms. Paula Knaus – indicate that they misuse you and your office in carrying out their unlawfulness.  When we see these things, we best consider that they are typical: to say less would be to give the wrongdoers credit that they in no manner deserve.     
 
One concern I have, and that your memo does not answer, is: Where did the concern about my January 19, 2001 letter to Governor Jeb Bush originate?  And what track did it follow on its way to being expressed to me?  The answer to those questions should reveal much, including who is it who wanted me terminated so badly, no matter how unlawfully it was done, that they were willing to open the University up to such an astronomical level of civil and criminal liability as we see, and in fact, were so intent on doing just that that they could not, by any means, be dissuaded from that objective.  Other questions, of course, are, “Why were they so intent?”  and “What is in it for them?”  
 
This whole matter of unlawful lock out has been one more example of the State of Florida’s being unable to come at me lawfully, whereby it simply ignores the law and comes at me unlawfully.  And why do those involved continue as though what they have done has some legitimacy, which it does not and cannot?  It cannot be said too often: we do not need, neither should we tolerate, crooks running this or any other institution of higher learning, and we are in sore need of a thorough housecleaning in that regard here at the University of South Florida.  Hanging accolades on wrongdoers must stop, once and for all!

Dear Mr. Griffin:
 
Governor Jeb Bush, in establishing the boards of trustees for the eleven (11) universities in the State University System (SUS) of Florida, has made a historic and courageous move, and history will show whether this has been for better or for worse.  As a member of the University of South Florida Board of Trustees, you have dedicated yourself to the better, and I thank you for committing yourself to such important public service.  I share your commitment, and therefore, write to you at the dawn of your duty.    
 
The urgency of getting this brief letter to you precludes my providing more detail at this time; however, you must know that the University of South Florida has opened itself up to civil and criminal liability that stands to devastate the institution, if not indeed the very institution of higher learning itself, and which also runs the very serious risk of exposing you and your fellow board members to public outrage and possibly prosecution.  The University of South Florida, as of May 22, 2001, has unlawfully, and I believe it is fair to say, with malice aforethought, terminated my employment, and has done so while at the same time saying I am a most valuable employee.  There being no middle ground, General Counsel Noreen Segrest stands with me against the unlawfulness of the University, and likewise, against the unlawfulness of its aiders and abettors, including: Dr. Henry W. Hanff; William R. “Bill” Webb – law firm Carlson Meissner; and the government.  I do not know why Ms. Segrest has not stopped the University from coming against me unlawfully in the first place, but the University must be stopped, and in fact, reversed.     
 
The proof of my own commitment to public service is reflected in the record of my nearly sixteen years of employment under the Florida Retirement System, including the past seven years at the University of South Florida: a record the University has unlawfully, and again maliciously, tarnished of late.  I have written this letter on University letterhead because it is my firm belief that as a vested State of Florida employee (appointment date: June 8, 1987) it is entirely fitting and proper: anything less would be to unduly diminish the importance of the matters at hand.  The University of South Florida, in coming against me unlawfully, has mirrored what I and mine have been fighting against, late December 1987 to date, throughout other sectors of state government: such unlawfulness must not be allowed to continue, and like yourself, I have personal, public and professional duties to expose it, as well as to turn it around.      
 
Among my most pressing concerns is that a month ago the University of South Florida unlawfully cut off my pay and benefits: moreover, as if to underscore its blatant disregard for the law and malice for me, the University has not, to date, so much as provided me with any information about continuing my benefits (ref: COBRA) which would be a problem even if the termination were lawful, which it is not and cannot be.  Instead, it amounts to an unlawful lock out with terroristic aspects: until the University’s unlawful siege against me is lifted, I can be reached at my home: 18060 Owen Drive, Hudson, Florida 34667; fax: (727) 863-2946; phone: (727) 819-1799; pager: (800) 940-9586; and electronic mail:  <mailto:victory@innet.com> victory@innet.com

Subject:	Michael Garner, Incarcerated at Tomoka Correctional Institution

My dear Governor Bush:
 
It has been my privilege to minister to prisoners through a program entitled "Kairos."  My first encounter as a "Godparent" there was with a young man named Michael Garner (VO4349).  I was struck by his complete candor, honesty, and his past responsibilities to his work, his family and his good citizenship.  He has a wife and two young children, and they are intensely loyal in visiting every week-end, and appear to be a very loving family.  
 
It is my understanding that Michael has been in the Kairos program for about 1-1/2 years now, and these past six months has been promoted to the title of "Encourager," which means he is responsible for stimulating the other inmates to become better God-fearing men who will become responsible citizens upon their release, or, in the case that there is no hope of release, that they graduate from the program and teach others what they have learned about anger control, responsibility to our neighbor, and to learn to trust in one another AND most of all, in God.  This man is a real example to others, and I have reason to believe that he is not responsible for what put him behind bars, since it was apparently due to a reaction to prescription medication which caused a complete change in his rational thinking and behavior.  
 
If you would only give this beautiful young man a chance by interceding for him,  I am sure you would be taking the only conscienable action that can be done.  Please accept my sincere thanks for your looking into this matter.  He is not a rich man, but he tells me even his church has had a drive to raise enough money to pay for legal fees to go forward on his behalf.   I believe in you, Mr. Bush, and in your family.  I know you to be a fair and honest governor.  I voted for you because of that, and am counting on you to keep up the good work you have been doing for our State of Florida.  Please look into the Kairos program - it is a world wide program promoting Christian values and we find the recidivism rate is unbelievable in those who graduate from the program.
 
Thank you.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Please accept this recommendation for Chief Chris Knight to become the new Director of the Florida Highway Patrol. Chief Knight has the experience and the leadership capabilities to guide the Patrol on a more progressive, productive, and professional course than it has demonstrated lately. Chief Knight also has the overwhelming support of the rank and file, and selecting Chief Knight as the Director would greatly improve the morale of the members of the Patrol and restore hope that our agency will once again become the premier, most elite, and very best agency in the state, in which members of other law enforcement agencies will want to be a part of.

One last thing, my office contacted our legislative staff partners (those
responsible for economic development appropriations and substantive
committees) to talk about the audit draft, note that we are in the comment
period, and let them know that Bill Cotterell was expected to write up
something prior to getting the Comptrollers final report.

I felt it was better to give them heads up and explain that the overall
audit is not a bad one, than to have to react to their queries once the
article shows.

Bill ...

	I believe we addressed the issue of the bank account that was kept
expressly to separate the private funds from state funds.  Your question as
to how much was in the account is a moving target ... money comes in, money
goes out.   At the end of the audit period, the balance in the account was
$2.38 million.
	As for the papers supplied to you by the Comptroller's Office ... I
don't think they classify these as "work papers," but that is probably
irrelevant.  These are simply notes the Comptroller's Office sent to Bill
Kean so he could start his research, which will form the basis of our
response, due July 13.  Frankly, I don't see how the Democrat can report on
these vague notes when many of them are not even complete thoughts.
	By my count, from the pages you faxed to us, there are 87 notations
and we simply can't explain each of them on the spot.  That is what Bill
Kean and his staff are trying to do for the Comptrollers' Office.  To report
on them without explanation has the clear potential to mislead your readers
about the audit and about the work and performance of EFI.
	We believe that our responses to the Comptroller's Preliminary Draft
will resolve most if not all of the questions that have been raised, and in
the process we will have emerged better for the exercise.  Independent
audits are a good thing - and we welcome them - but independent auditors are
also removed from the day-to-day operations of the organization they are
auditing and might not know what to ask for, which results in the kind of
questions that are noted in the papers supplied to you by the Comptoller's
Office.
As you will see in the attached memo from Bill Kean to Mark Merry, much of
the documentation said to be missing was in fact not missing at all.
Rather, documentation is often kept in other files -- such as contract
folders -- as opposed to the accounting files.
In the end, Enterprise Florida is about a new model ... the public-private
partnership ... where the best features of state government and private
enterprise are merged to achieve greater results. As a recent Ernst & Young
study shows, EFI returns to the state $4 for every $1 invested ... and EFI
has exceeded its job creation objectives every year. 
Please let us know what else we can do for you.

Attached is an email from Mark Mays.  

In a nutshell, they fear that after the transportation bill was vetoed,
counties are going to begin mobilizing to pass ordinances requiring
amortization instead of just compensation.  They are seeking some kind of
clairification as to our true position on the issue to help head any
movement off at the pass.  

My feeling is that we should let the veto letter speak for itself -- maybe
send another letter with the veto letter explaining again that the veto
message was explicit in our rationale and recognizing the tremendous
progress that was made this year in conversations with the counties --
hesitant to go beyond that.

In addition, a hopeful letter from you, might only encourage counties to
mobilize against the billboard folks.  Now, the counties think they have
won, and they probably think you vetoed the bill b/c of this issue, so there
may not be as much incentive for them to do what Mark says. 

I told Mark we would discuss.

Mr. Jeb Bush

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
Dear Mr. Bush:
 
The 21st century education delivery system is already a reality that will soon benefit all of us. The independent sector has mirrored the Governor’s goals for education and believes that the Commission for Independent Education will be a key-element in this new system. We, at Florida Christian University, believe on that and also understand that Dr. Joel Mullenix should be appointed to that Commission as Chairman, under SB 1162.
 
The caring, commitment, collaboration, and leadership that Dr. Freeberg has dedicated to the development of the independent education sector in Florida firmly indicates that he will achieve even greater accomplishments as the Executive Director of Division of Independent Education.
 
Florida Christian University is an educational institution established in 1985, in the State of Florida. Nowadays we are present in more than 50 countries, and we have more than 1,000 students all around the world. We really hope you will provide the opportunity for continuing to count on the seamless collaboration of Dr. Freeberg.
May God bless you.

The caring, commitment, collaboration, and leadership that Dr. Freeberg has dedicated to the development of the independent education sector in Florida, firmly indicates that he will achieve even greater accomplishments as the Executive Director of Division of Independent Education.
 
Florida Christian University is an educational institution established in 1985, in the State of Florida. Nowadays we are present in more than 50 countries, and we have more than 1,000 students all around the world. We really hope you will provide the opportunity for continuing to count on the seamless collaboration of Dr. Freeberg.
 
May God bless you.
 
Sincerely,
 
Anthony B. Portigliatti

Dear Pam

I wanted to submit my strongest recommendation for this request of a letter
under the Governor's signature supporting the Greater Miami Chamber's
application for a US Department of Commerce - ITA Market Cooperator Grant in
the amount of $400,000.
If we can obtain this grant it will be used to leverage the $400,000 line
item appropriation in this year's budget, for the Florida Services Export
Promotion Program. Using this grant the  Chamber 

This is an already a unique program in the United States and this Federal
Grant would enable us to take it's center piece the FloridaServiceNet.com
web site, which currently includes over 2200 Florida service providers, to
the next level. This is a product that has the potential to give Florida
service providers a great edge competing worldwide and solidify our growing
reputation as an international E-Business center.

A draft letter is attached. Please let me know if you have any questions. I
am copying Betty since the E-mail from the chamber went directly to Governor
Bush.

Dear Governor:

We would like to request a letter under your signature in support of our
grant application for the Market Development Cooperator Program of the
International Trade Administration of the United States Department of
Commerce.  The International Trade Administration is currently reviewing the
applications and the winners are expected to be announced by Linda Conlin,
Assistant Secretary, in September.  Attached is the Executive Summary of the
application that was submitted to expand and promote the Florida Services
Export Program.

As you know, the Florida Services Export Program is the first statewide and
comprehensive strategy to export knowledge-based services in the United
States.  Currently, over 2200 companies are participating in our program
with great success. The funds received by the Market Development Cooperator
Program and the private sector will be used to match the $400,000
appropriation from the State of Florida approved by you this year.  These
funds will allow us to dramatically expand and promote the
FloridaServiceNet.com and business matchmaking programs to bring more
dollars and jobs to Florida.

Attached is a suggested draft of the letter to the staff responsible for the
Market Development Cooperator Program in the United States Department of
Commerce.  Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at
the Chamber, Manny Mencia at Enterprise Florida or Dr. Pam Dana in your
office. Their extensive knowledge and strong support has been critical to
our efforts.  Additionally, you may contact Walter Revell or Tony Villamil,
two of our key business volunteers leading this initiative at the Chamber.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support of the
Florida Services Export program during this challenging legislative year.
Our staff and volunteers are excited to have the opportunity to work with
you and your staff to make Florida a leader in the export of knowledge-based
services. Undoubtedly your strong leadership and active support has already
helped us advance toward this goal.  We look forward to your continued
support.

Jeb,

Great selections!

As usual the liberal journalists at The Tampa Tribune yesterday found fault, 
reciting the tired list of political correctness - color, women, poor, 
educationists, etc.. Today the Trib's editorialists weighed in with a more 
positive opinion. But too many folks that  I encounter have already been 
brain-washed by the unending whinging of the left against the education 
reform. I truly admire your sticking to the plan, because I know that 
empowering the local trustees is the best path to the future.

What I see is the appointment of a Board with really good , experienced and 
truly talented people who can help Judy Genschaft accelerate the drive for 
excellence, not just more students, at USF. That and that alone should be the 
criteria for selection and you did it well. 

One thing I am still puzzled by is the price and cost  situation. I don't 
think the cost per student year at a Florida university is so much less than 
at Harvard, Stanford, Michigan or North Carolina that we can afford to under 
price them by so great an amount. The difference must be in the amount of 
state subsidy or [income from the endowment for a private school]. Why should 
wealthy parents of Florida students be getting this huge discount on college 
tuition? If we were to charge a market price to those who could afford to pay 
it and give scholarship assistance to those who can't afford to pay, it seems 
to me the result would be additional monies to improve the academic aspects 
of our universities? I wonder how long we can continue to use the state 
budget to fund more and more university education at below market prices.

Keep up the good job - we will win in '02

Best regards,  Ken Hoyt

We continue to receive phone calls from small minority vendors in Miami complaining about United Home Care.  I have asked Mike to listen to one of the calls.  We learned a variety of violations of which one caught my attention:   United Home care sent flyers/newsletters during election time asking all their clients to support  a preselected set of Democrats

We have received phone calls from CCE agencies in Jacksonville supporting the decision of the AAA to conduct medicaid case management functions.  I am giving you the phone numbers of two of the agencies (if you want I can give you all four) in case you would like to verify the story

Dear Jeb: 

For approximately a month and a half, I have been trying to get the 
Scheduling Office to give me a date for you to attend the grand opening and 
USA kickoff for Telefonica-Data USA in Miami-Dade County.  As you are 
probably aware, Telefonica is one of the world's largest corporations and has 
an eighty-five (85%) percent saturation in Spain and South America.  Their 
annual revenues are in the 10's of billions and they are launching their 
American operations at the Lightspeed Center (formerly known as Beacon 
Tradeport).  As a part of their plan and announcement, as an example, Lycos 
will be announcing the relocation of their North American corporate 
headquarters from New York (together with all of their employees) to the 
Telefonica facilities in Miami-Dade.  Hewlett Packard will also be making 
major relocations, and your attendance at their opening and USA kickoff is 
very important to them. 

In fact, Cesar Alierta, the Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of 
Telefonica Worldwide (from Spain) intends to attend as does the Chief 
Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard, if you are willing to participate.   
This high-tech commitment will be like no other in Florida or anywhere in 
America.  The plan also includes many other South American relocations to 
these data facilities. 

We were unable to get a commitment for June or July on your schedule and they 
are now proposing Wednesday, September 19 as a preferred new date well in 
advance, in order to try and secure your commitment.  Mr. Alierta is a 
substantial international figure that will bring significant credibility and 
recognition for what is taking place in Florida and under your agenda, and I 
know you will recognize this.   

I need to get back to the principals in Spain and other places very quickly, 
and I would appreciate it if you could encourage your staff to approve this 
time on your schedule.  They would be looking for you to participate in a 
morning press conference and a noontime lunch meeting, which will be full of 
telecom executives from throughout the world.  This is a major coup for you 
and your administration.  I can have full briefing materials made available 
as you may request. 

Thanks for considering this request.

We apologize for reaching you like this, however we have an emergency 
situation and Mary Collins was kind enough to provide us with a direct 
contact to you. 

I would like to bring to your attention the situation of this young child 
who is fighting for his life. 

Abel Valencia is a very unfortunate 13 year old from Colombia who came to 
our attention in March 1999 following a syncopal episode.  A thorough 
investigation showed that he had Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve, 
which caused a severe impairment of the function of the right ventricle 
causing severe heart failure.  He underwent right atrial reduction and 
tricuspid valvuloplasty in 1999, but soon after surgery he rapidly developed 
again worsening of heart failure and ascites with a protein-loosing 
enteropathy.  Since then, his condition has been gradually deteriorating. 

In May 2001 he had two strokes and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation 
and he had some thrombi in the heart.  He has also developed thrombosis of 
the radial artery.  After appropriate anticoagulation, he underwent again 
open heart surgery to try to improve his condition. 

After surgery, he had a persistent bleeding and he was required to be taken 
back to the operating room where he experienced a prolonged cardiac arrest 
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and because of the poor cardiac 
function he was placed on a mechanical pump. 

Abel today underwent orthotopic heart transplant, which was the only option 
to keep him alive.  He is currently in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, at 
Jackson Memorial Hospital. 

Abel will require long term medical care and medications to prevent the 
rejection of his new heart.  The initial applications to the Children's 
Medical Service and Florida Medicaid were rejected because of the lack of 
immigration papers.  I kindly ask if there is any way that we can help this 
unfortunate child, who has already been through so much at this young age. 

Thank you for your immediate assistance to this matter. Please feel free to 
contact me for any further information.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

My choice is Chris Knight; he is a strong leader with outstanding character. The Patrol has been changed in a very unfavorable way since the day that Colonel Burkett took over and Fred Dickinson. We were respected as an organization before them, however now we are simply the stepchild for Mr. Dickinson. The position of Colonel has become a launching point for retirement with a big check. Chris Knight actually has a respect for the troopers and understands the problems the Patrol has. We need Chris Knight, I can't emphasis this enough, Leadership, Experience, Willingness to move us ahead instead of dragging us further behind. Policy has to be current with Modern Day, In short the Patrol has lost sight of its mission, and Chris Knight is the person who can motivate the Troopers to a new high. Yes the process will be slow, We are a division of a non law enforcement agency, because of that we do not have the attention or interest of the Department Head, so until Mr.Dickinson leaves or we come out of DHSMV the going for any new Colonel will be slow. We need to be our own Department like we used to be, and report to the Governor and cabinet

Governor Bush,
    I just wanted to let you know how disappointed I was at the veto of the money set aside for clean up of the tributaries of the Loxahatchee River. Our neighborhood was hopeful that we had met all your criteria for being approved in the budget. We are not one of the wealthy areas of Jupiter and the clean up would have made a huge difference in the outlook residents have of our little neighborhood. I understand the difficult decisions you have to make when it comes to the money that the state spends on projects. I believe you are doing a good job as governor and am hopeful you will run for reelection.

Governor: 

This is my proposed response to Mr. Clark re: the juvenile prevention issues: 

Dear Mr. Clark: 

Thank you for writing me regarding juvenile-justice prevention programs and my vetoes. Although I did veto some juvenile-prevention spending items, you may be pleased to know that our state budget for next year invests $71.5 million in juvenile prevention, which is 64% higher than just five years ago when our state only provided $43.7 million in juvenile-prevention projects. Regarding the Boys and Girls clubs you mentioned, I approved a $2 million appropriation for those clubs in the education budget. By my actions, Boys and Girls Clubs statewide can continue to provide their valuable services.

I agree with you that it is better to prevent crime than simply punish offenders, although we must do both. Juvenile crime is down in Florida, and we're seeing strong results from my "tough love" initiative which focuses on prevention, intervention and accountability.  Last year alone, juvenile arrests for the most serious crimes dropped 7.1 percent. 

As you know, we must prioritize taxpayer dollars in all government spending. In the area of juvenile prevention programs, the Department of Juvenile Justice has developed an approach that seeks to identify those youth most likely to become repeat or violent offenders. We can then focus our prevention spending on programs that serve these youth.  Before this year's legislative session, my office of Policy and Budget contacted 500 program providers to inform them that we would evaluate juvenile-prevention spending in the budget based on whether the youth served met the following criteria:

1) Significant family problems as evidenced by child abuse or neglect findings, a criminal family member, or a lack of parental supervision and control; 

2) significant problems at school as evidenced by truancy, failing more than one course, or a suspension or expulsion within the last 6 months; 

3) a pattern of substance abuse, including drugs, alcohol or smoking cigarettes; and 
4) pre-delinquent behavior as evidenced by gang membership, chronic running away, a pattern of stealing; or mental health problems associated with delinquent behavior."  

Projects in the budget not meeting these criteria were not approved. This did not mean that vetoed projects were not worthy of private financial contributions or support from local government, but only that they were not appropriately funded in the juvenile-justice budget.  Regarding Suspension With A Purpose, my office spoke with Sheriff Dawsey regarding our process. My office offered to help him next year to seek funding to target those youth most likely to become repeat or violent juvenile offenders. 

Thank you again for writing. I regret that you are disappointed by some of my budget actions, but I hope this information provides some clarification as to our goal to use  state taxpayer dollars in the most efficient manner.

Gov. Jeb, 

With your recent rejection of funding for various youth programs 
to include Boys & Girls Clubs, Suspension With A Purpose and others 
it appears to me you are being "penny wise and pound foolish". 
Failing to fund these programs now will only end up costing us more 
later in Judicial, Incarceration and Police expenses, lots more. 
It is a lot less expensive to build a Youth facility than a Jail not 
to mention the Police/Sheriff station and courthouse that need to be 
built or expanded along with the jail. This makes no sense to me unless 
one of your hidden goals is to continue to create Gov't Sprawl and 
ultimately a Police State. 

I also question your cancelling of funding for alternative energy 
research along with many of your other decisions and reversals from 
campaign statements. 

It appears to me that my supporting you for election and voting for 
you was a mistake as your actions speak differently than your words. 
This is a mistake I will not repeat if your actions continue down 
these paths. I am not a sit at home, keep my mouth shut voter so 
take note that my concerns and impressions will not rest in the 
shade.

Dear Jeb.
I will be flying to Chile with the Team Florida and Pastor Markus Bishop will

relationship. I have no dough in my mind than you are going to get to be
good and close friends, the two of you are so much alike than is incredible.
We will be flying Delta from Atlanta to Santiago on the July 15 arriving in 
Santiago
on Monday the 16th at 8:00 AM. We could not fly from Miami because
first class was full. We have a suite reserved at the Sheraton.
I am looking forward to see you again.

Dear Members:
 
I wrote your last email during pre-dawn. By the time I wrote this it was dawn. 
So forgive me for being kinda dumb at that hour.
 
Now, I haven’t pre-screened this dumb idea with the expert on this subject. 
First, it was too early to be decent. As I edit later, I know that Red Leader Ed Turanchik 
is always OVERSCHEDULED and can only return calls, like his cell phone says, “when practical.” 
My best strategy is to learn when he can’t get that helicopter to hop from Tampa to Orlando 
and has to drive I-4. Then, I can catch him en route by cell if I’m lucky, only interrupted by fuel and/or
 pit stops. So here I go on my own:
 
 
Regarding the Olympics, I have an early-morning daydream or "dumb 
idea" to relate. Just before retiring at 1 am, I read yesterday's article in 
the Wall St. Journal (Page B1) about the distressed situation of the Greek 
Summer Olympics slated for 2004. (This is how my mind works at night: problem 
before bed, REM sleep, potential solution upon waking. Any of you do that, too?) 
The Greeks have been and are continuing to have incredible problems in pulling 
this event off and it might potentially be disastrous. Well, upon, waking up 
this morning, I practically was, as Red Leader Ed Turanchik would say, 
"jumping out of my pants" with a grand idea--which might be in another of 
Red Leader's terms, "non-productive…"
 
Well, Florida 2012 has saved the Pan American Games finals (or, perhaps 
semi-finals) from problems in Miami. The gang has helped work with the Florida 
Sports Authority to save and enhance Florida's statewide Sunshine Games in 
the aftermath of a public-private sports organization merger in which I 
represented the Governor's Office (a long story).
 
Now, Red Leader, his outstanding staff and his incredible Board are going to 
go bananas when I mention this: Why not preempt all that bidding and site 
selection stuff, offer to take over those games saving the IOC and the 
Greeks a world of embarrassment and just do them right here in Tampa and 
Orlando two years from now. 
 
We could start all those federal funds flowing right away through 
extraordinary Congressional action, start letting all those construction 
contracts for the required new facilities, start repainting all the required 
existing facilities, fill up all those hotel rooms (which, perhaps, may 
already be booked, I realize) and cruise ships, really jam on high speed rail 
design and construction and a host of other federally funded transportation 
improvements we desperately need (starting with I-4 and I-275), carry out all 
those implementation plans Ed and his team and consultants have already 
prepared in the course of having to submit their exhaustive bid, PULL IT OFF, and get the 
whole dang thing done and over with, reaping all the benefits EIGHT YEARS 
EARLIER WITHOUT HAVING TO BOTHER WITH ANY COMPETITION IN THE US AND THEN 
WORLDWIDE. 
 
We wouldn't have to worry ourselves with the imminent decision over whether Toronto 
or China get the 2008 Olympics, thus impacting our efforts to sell North 
America AGAIN a mere four years later!
 
Now, Red Leader, the savior of the 2004 Summer Olympics would have an 
assured future as head of the IOC, and think of the JOB THAT IS and what Red Leader 
could with THAT JOB. Everyone, from staff, consultants, contractors to banks, supporters 
and so on, who helped pull it off would become famous in their respective fields for doing 
so. And everything that Central Florida needs in transportation and many 
other public improvements could happen (or be made to happen in the 
exuberance over it all) and Central Florida might get up to speed, capacity 
might match demand, and life and prosperity improve faster than the speed of 
light, which is the pace we all set for ourselves.
 
Tampa Bay has the spunk to pull it off and Orlando, if all factions work 
together, could as well. WELL, JUST THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR A MINUTE! I'm 
not an expert at sports, in the sports business, much less intimate with the arcane 
machinations of "the Olympic Family," but sometimes I have grand ideas, even 
on four hours of sleep, that can spark some lively reactions, discussions and 
ACTION.
 
Then, again, maybe, I just should have not "jumped out of my pants" and gone 
back to sleep, so that Pam and I can keep faxing, doing customized letters 
for you to our Congressional delegation (which I really, genuinely suspect 
each of you have the capacity to write in your own style based on the logic 
in the Resolution on HSRIA that really speaks for itself because True Genius and I worked really hard 
on getting the Resolution down just right, and then Pam has all the the addresses to send out), hit ten other 
priorities, react to crises and events at our usual pace.
 
Well, we'll likely do a model letter anyway. Heck, by now, Pam's already there jamming 
the fax to our state's legislators. And, she’s actually already done, so now there’s trade 
associations and groups like the Florida Chamber to do
 
Now, I have to get ready for work, you know, “back in my pants” and everything 
so I fit in with the community in which I live and work, and grab my 
briefcase and run.
 
This will be forwarded to the office (in AOL format, whatever that might end 
up being) so I can then send it out to all of you. I hope you find it of some 
value as we move ahead.
 
Thank you,
Travis

Governor,
After reviewing your University Trustee appointments thus far, it is very
apparent that the old system (BOR) was a model, which limited the number of
qualified people who could become involved in higher education.  Most of the
appointments are quite remarkable individuals who will only enhance our
system by their active participation.  You've succeeded in breaking up what
amounted to (in the past) an exclusive, white-male dominated club (the BOR)
and creating a richer, more diverse group of citizens, well skilled to
tackle the challenges of advancing higher education for our state.
Congrats!

Gov. Bush,
 
I am honored.  Do you have any suggestions concerning how I can be more successful in helping the community?  
 
Please keep abreast of the city of Homestead and their financial health.  The city has major problems.  I am also concerned about Opa-Locka, and two other smaller municipalities.  Almost all the municipalities have co-opted some of Hurricane  Andrew's FEMA money giving them past solvency and the money is now either spent or coming due. 
 
Another problem is small municipalities cannot attract seasoned city managers and it is difficult to recruit qualified financial staff.  The city managers are nice people but not financial fireball's with a thorough understanding of all of a city's financial obligations and there long term ramifications.
 
I thank you again for reading the Watchdog Report.

Timothy J. Keegan community activist and chair of the Biscayne Shores Community Council has 
put forth yet another site for the Florida Marlin's stadium.  The proposed stadium location, not in his community council district, is the former Munisport/Interama.  A 75-acre toxic waste dump, the site is centrally located near Sunny Isles, North Miami Beach and North Miami and is adjacent to Florida International University north campus.
 
Keegan says the plan to have the stadium in the city of Miami is fundamentally flawed and is being driven by political considerations not by attendance and economic factors.  Keegan sees this site as an attractive alternative that takes into consideration the teams existing fan base in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

Dear Governor:

We would like to request a letter under your signature in support of our
grant application for the Market Development Cooperator Program of the
International Trade Administration of the United States Department of
Commerce.  The International Trade Administration is currently reviewing the
applications and the winners are expected to be announced by Linda Conlin,
Assistant Secretary, in September.  Attached is the Executive Summary of the
application that was submitted to expand and promote the Florida Services
Export Program.

As you know, the Florida Services Export Program is the first statewide and
comprehensive strategy to export knowledge-based services in the United
States.  Currently, over 2200 companies are participating in our program
with great success. The funds received by the Market Development Cooperator
Program and the private sector will be used to match the $400,000
appropriation from the State of Florida approved by you this year.  These
funds will allow us to dramatically expand and promote the
FloridaServiceNet.com and business matchmaking programs to bring more
dollars and jobs to Florida.

Attached is a suggested draft of the letter to the staff responsible for the
Market Development Cooperator Program in the United States Department of
Commerce.  Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at
the Chamber, Manny Mencia at Enterprise Florida or Dr. Pam Dana in your
office. Their extensive knowledge and strong support has been critical to
our efforts.  Additionally, you may contact Walter Revell or Tony Villamil,
two of our key business volunteers leading this initiative at the Chamber.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support of the
Florida Services Export program during this challenging legislative year.
Our staff and volunteers are excited to have the opportunity to work with
you and your staff to make Florida a leader in the export of knowledge-based
services. Undoubtedly your strong leadership and active support has already
helped us advance toward this goal.  We look forward to your continued
support.

Gov. Jeb,

With your recent rejection of funding for various youth programs 
to include Boys & Girls Clubs, Suspension With A Purpose and others 
it appears to me you are being "penny wise and pound foolish".
Failing to fund these programs now will only end up costing us more
later in Judicial, Incarceration and Police expenses, lots more.
It is a lot less expensive to build a Youth facility than a Jail not 
to mention the Police/Sheriff station and courthouse that need to be
built or expanded along with the jail. This makes no sense to me unless
one of your hidden goals is to continue to create Gov't Sprawl and
ultimately a Police State. 

I also question your cancelling of funding for alternative energy
research along with many of your other decisions and reversals from
campaign statements.

It appears to me that my supporting you for election and voting for
you was a mistake as your actions speak differently than your words.
This is a mistake I will not repeat if your actions continue down
these paths. I am not a sit at home, keep my mouth shut voter so
take note that my concerns and impressions will not rest in the 
shade.

Ms. Segrest:

The attached is for your information and follow through, including against
Barr Murman law firm.  This is the law firm, as I understand it, that former
Chief Judge Denny Alvarez has joined since leaving the bench, which alone,
should tell you something.  Back in 1991 - 1992, my parents thought Jim
Murman came across as "mafia mean."  Their lawyer Mitchell L. Meeks was
unlawfully granted an unlawful withdrawal by the infamous, cowboy-boot
wearing Judge W. Lowell Bray in 1992 and at that time was also granted money
which he had in no manner earned, but had earned the criminal and civil
liability thereof, as had the firm, of course.  In fact, the money had no
legal existence!  I believe Sandra Murman (Rep.?) may be Jim Murman's wife:
the plot thickens.

Take courage: the law is on our side, and we are to take full advantage of
that refuge.

Subject: A child with a new heart needs help 


Governor Jeb Bush 

We apologize for reaching you like this, however we have an emergency 
situation and Mary Collins was kind enough to provide us with a direct 
contact to you. 

I would like to bring to your attention the situation of this young child 
who is fighting for his life. 

Abel Valencia is a very unfortunate 13 year old from Colombia who came to 
our attention in March 1999 following a syncopal episode.  A thorough 
investigation showed that he had Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve, 
which caused a severe impairment of the function of the right ventricle 
causing severe heart failure.  He underwent right atrial reduction and 
tricuspid valvuloplasty in 1999, but soon after surgery he rapidly developed 
again worsening of heart failure and ascites with a protein-loosing 
enteropathy.  Since then, his condition has been gradually deteriorating. 

In May 2001 he had two strokes and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation 
and he had some thrombi in the heart.  He has also developed thrombosis of 
the radial artery.  After appropriate anticoagulation, he underwent again 
open heart surgery to try to improve his condition. 

After surgery, he had a persistent bleeding and he was required to be taken 
back to the operating room where he experienced a prolonged cardiac arrest 
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and because of the poor cardiac 
function he was placed on a mechanical pump. 

Abel today underwent orthotopic heart transplant, which was the only option 
to keep him alive.  He is currently in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, at 
Jackson Memorial Hospital. 

Abel will require long term medical care and medications to prevent the 
rejection of his new heart.  The initial applications to the Children's 
Medical Service and Florida Medicaid were rejected because of the lack of 
immigration papers.  I kindly ask if there is any way that we can help this 
unfortunate child, who has already been through so much at this young age. 

Thank you for your immediate assistance to this matter. Please feel free to 
contact me for any further information. 


Sincerely yours,

Dear members and friends,

You'll recall the letter a member received from a developer because a
satellite dish is installed on his home....repeat....HIS HOME!

But, you'll remember; HIS HOME is a in one of our Florida deed restricted
communities which had a mandatory homeowners association for 'mutual
benefit' purposes until residents decided they wouldn't serve as a
director/officer.

Incidentally, in this particular Marion county community the developer
refused to provide a yearly financial report of expenditures and receipts to
residents, pursuant to s. 689.265 F.S. Financial Report (disclosure) since
the law was enacted in 1995.

Approximately three years ago, when residents refused to serve on the board
of directors of the HOA the developer created for 'mutual benefit' purposes
the developer finally provided a financial report, AND disbanded the
HOA....the financial report sent to residents?...ZERO Collected, ZERO Spent.

Of course, he was correct! Why?

The amenity fees and/or assessments have been and continue to be collected
by the developer's FOR PROFIT corporation(s) NOT the HOA!

So much for accountability and inadequate state laws, specifically, s.
689.265  F.S. which doesn't require an audit of finances spent by the
developer, nor; penalties for failure to comply, nor; administrative codes
to insure enforcement, etc...

Not to worry! Marion county commissioners to the rescue. YEAH RIGHT!

This group has been unable to cure the problem despite adopting an
ill-advised ordinance last year. Ohh...you say, an election year?...Hmmm?

Yep, you've heard this before and there doesn't seem to be an end to the
story!

Actually, this story isn't going to end until our three branches of
government in Tallahassee remove their heads from the sand and advocate
meaningful reform of Chapter 720 (formerly ss. 617.301-617.312), s. 689.26
Disclosure (before contract for sale) and s. 689.265 Financial Report (after
contract for sale) to protect residents of deed restricted communties
enticed to relocate.

Unfortunately, for residents, the power and the influence of the
stakeholders and industry partisans has thwarted meaningful reform for 20+
years and will probably do so during the 2002 Legislative session. We'll
see?

Anyhow!

Back to the Satellite Dish fiasco!

If you're faced with a satellite dish issue you might be interested in the
response we've received from the FCC?

* SEE BELOW *

We continue to await receipt of a response from the Satellite Broadcasting
Communication Association, i.e, SBCA! We'll let you know, when and if we do.

As for my directive to you yesterday, asking you to see to it that my pay is brought current, I notice that this has not happened yet, and I must impress upon you that my financial situation is already critical and is getting worse daily.  I’ll expect to see a substantial deposit – at least two paycheck’s worth -- reflected after 2 p.m. today.  The State of Florida already has my direct-deposit information.  
 
Do keep me apprised of your follow through on my behalf, and I, of course, will keep you apprised as well.  Attorney-client privilege, of course, applies to our relationship.  Do be aware that I copy Governor Jeb Bush, Attorney General John Ashcroft, and President George W. Bush on nearly everything I write about these matters.  This is not about politics: each of the foregoing has taken an oath to uphold and defend the United States Constitution, and I intend to do my utmost to help – and to require – them to do just that.  Of course, I expect no less from you, my counselor, and in that trust, I remain

The Honorable Jeb Bush:

I am impressed by the news today of the eFlorida plan to attract e-business
to our state.  I note for your Honor that the July 2001 issue of the ABA
Journal has an article that may relate to this cause entitled "Courting Tech
Business" by Victoria Rivkin, pp. 39-41, which your staff may wish to
consult.  The short of it is that Delaware, New York, and now Maryland and
Michigan are offering high - tech courts (as a separate division like family
courts).  For example, it could take a year or more to bring a case to
issue.  Under this system, a start-up company that might only survive for 18
months gets a judge that knows the terminology and an expedited docket to
assure access to the courts within the lifetime of the start-up.  For
example, these courts publish internet opinions, provide internet access to
dockets, and allow for video teleconferencing of court meetings and
hearings.

Jeb,

I had dinner tonight with the Chairman of the High Speed Ground 
Transportation Association (Bill Neville, who I think met in agroup with you 
maybe six-eight weeks ago), who also happens to be a Washington executive of 
a great big engineering firm that might just have more than fleeting interest 
in bidding on $4.5M our favorite state just generously appropriated for 
high-speed rail. (Now, as I recall, the meeting was after a big group of 
firms "demanded" that morning that the state make a big, serious committment 
to HSR before any private investors did!) 

[You may not have known this, but, in our attempt to try to avoid REALLY 
blatant self-interest, we don't offer invitations to, or accept requests for 
membership from firms that would actually design, build or operate such a 
system (e.g., Lockheed). THAT is one thing our leadership and I learned from 
the whole FOX deal and why we believe we are a bit more credible than just 
your average consortium.]

Heads up: He told me he was going to invite you to be Chairman of his big, 
national organization's upcoming annual conference here in Orlando (Wyndham 
in July, I believe). Apparently, they moved their conference here recently 
from Louisiana because there was not adequate "support," whatever that means. 
He also said Tommy Thompson, who we all know (in my case, that's know of) and 
love, did this last year or the year before, setting some sort of precedent 
in his mind, for you. 

I took this opportunity to tell him, and he's a good buddy with "Doc," that 
in my humble and removed position, I thought the only thing that would 
convince you to support high-speed rail was a group of seriously committed 
private investors who mustered the courage and resources to present you an 
honest deal, with no smoke or mirrors, that really took financial 
responsibility for such a project and kept the state's role de minimus.

I hope I have read you right, conveyed an appropriate opinion, and that I, in 
no way, spoke out of turn. Personally, I thought it was a good message to 
send, for whatever my opinion might be worth, to this particular community.

Trying my best,

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

After speaking with dozens of other troopers the common choice seems to be Chief Knight. I've only been a trooper for three years but I have never heard anybody say anything less that wonderful things about Chief Knight. I've never met him but believe me when people speak their mind in closed company and nobody has anything bad to say about him, that says alot. Everyone agrees that we need a real leader to bring the FHP into the next century. Lets face it, next to California, Florida is the busiest state in the country yet our department is way behind the times (i.e. 1950 radio technology). We need somebody to bring our department up to par. Somebody who has not forgotten what it is like to be a road trooper. Working the road seems to be so diffrent than five or ten years ago. Our department has been focusing too much on "tradition." Well times have changed. If you look at other states, the state police (i.e. highway patrol) is always the most respected. That is not the case in Florida. We have lost our respect because we have fallen behind the times. This in turn leads to shortage in manpower and higher turnover. Something needs to be done because we are only hurting ourselves. Chief Knight can turn this agency around, he remembers what it is like to work the road. He can make the FHP what it once was.

Dear Governor:

We would like to request a letter under your signature in support of our
grant application for the Market Development Cooperator Program of the
International Trade Administration of the United States Department of
Commerce.  The International Trade Administration is currently reviewing the
applications and the winners are expected to be announced by Linda Conlin,
Assistant Secretary, in September.  Attached is the Executive Summary of the
application that was submitted to expand and promote the Florida Services
Export Program.

As you know, the Florida Services Export Program is the first statewide and
comprehensive strategy to export knowledge-based services in the United
States.  Currently, over 2200 companies are participating in our program
with great success. The funds received by the Market Development Cooperator
Program and the private sector will be used to match the $400,000
appropriation from the State of Florida approved by you this year.  These
funds will allow us to dramatically expand and promote the
FloridaServiceNet.com and business matchmaking programs to bring more
dollars and jobs to Florida.

Attached is a suggested draft of the letter to the staff responsible for the
Market Development Cooperator Program in the United States Department of
Commerce.  Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at
the Chamber, Manny Mencia at Enterprise Florida or Dr. Pam Dana in your
office. Their extensive knowledge and strong support has been critical to
our efforts.  Additionally, you may contact Walter Revell or Tony Villamil,
two of our key business volunteers leading this initiative at the Chamber.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support of the
Florida Services Export program during this challenging legislative year.
Our staff and volunteers are excited to have the opportunity to work with
you and your staff to make Florida a leader in the export of knowledge-based
services. Undoubtedly your strong leadership and active support has already
helped us advance toward this goal.  We look forward to your continued
support.

Subject:	State Bd. of Education

Dear Governor Bush:
I want to commend you on your selections to the State Board of Education
but am very disappointed that you didn't select someone from Hillsborough
County to be on the board.  Hillsborough has one of the largest  school
districts and one would have thought that Hillsborough would have been
represented
on the board.

I do have some suggestions that I think should be considered especially
when this relates to Hillsborough County.  The suggestions are as
follows:
1. The local school boards should have some responsibility to the state
and its citizens on how the money allocated to each county is spent.  In
Hillsborough County we have a "top heavy" administration that saw fit to
give themselves "bonuses" this past year even though we have overcrowded
classrooms and  many portable classrooms. The bonuses ranged from $20,000
-$30,000.  The money could have been better spent on either hiring more
teachers, giving teacher raises or saving the money for future building
of new schools.  The teachers in the area have labeled the building that
the local school board uses for their administrators "The Taj Mahal" or
the "Ivory Tower" for there are 3 very large floors filled with
non-teaching administrators  plus the administrators in each of the
schools.  No wonder the public school system needs so money to operate.
The sad thing is that the front line teachers see very little of the
school  funding.  In the private sector only the principal of a school is
exempt from teaching in a classroom and the administrators running the
private system are less than 1/10 of what they are in the public sector.
It would be interesting to see in print how much of the budget is used
for teacher salaries verus the amounts given to the administrative side.
I believe there have to be some fiscal responsibility and some
accountability on how funds are used.

2. Teachers need a phone number in Tallahassee to handle problems that
are not solved at the local level.  Many teachers are afraid of saying
anything for fear of losing their jobs.  Local school districts are most
likely to shove problems "under the rug" rather solve them.  Teachers
need someone at a higher level to look at the allegations and to find a
remedy for the problems.

3. Schools need to have a uniform method of handling ISS (In School
Suspension) .  In some schools there is a special teacher to handle ISS
while in other schools, ISS is handled by any teacher that has a "free
period" during the day.  You will find in the schools with a set teacher
ISS has specific rules and regulations and ISS is truly a punishment for
bad behavior or excessive absences.  Students under these regulations
generally return to their classes knowing that the previous bad behavior
will no longer be tolerated while students in classes with different
teachers generally behave no differently than they did in their classes
before they were removed. When these students return to classes their bad
behavior is not modified.    

Since you have become governor there have been notable changes for the
good.  The voucher system for one. Without the voucher system Florida
would still have failing schools.  The voucher served as a wake-up call
to the schools- either improve or students will have the chance to go to
schools that are not failing.  Unfortunately the teachers are going too
far in some cases.  Some schools and teachers teach students the whole
year on how to pass the FCAT rather than teaching the subject matter that
they are assigned to teach. If you are a good teacher, the students
should be able to pass the FCAT easily with the knowledge they learned in
class.  Spending the whole year teaching students how to pass the FCAT is
like a teacher giving the students the answers before an exam.
I also think having a State Board of Education is good because the board
can look at the "whole picture" of educating students from kindergarten
through college.  I also think the idea of having a Board of Trustees for
each college and university is a good one.  Each Board of Trustees will
look after the needs and welfare of each college and university but there
will be dialogue and communication back and forward from the State Board
of Education.  Dialogue and communication are VERY IMPORTANT.

I realize that the election in 2002 will be a tough one.  I am precinct
chairwoman for precinct #751 and if I can help your campaign for
reelection please let me know.  My precinct delivered very well in the
2000 election ---70% for George W. We have over 4,800 voters in 751.

Dear Jeb,
A friend and a supporter of you, should be unconditional.  If you make
someone mad about not being able to serve on the Board, they surely must
be shallow, and you don't need them around!  Don't fret about that!!!
About the celebration dinner at the Uf for the Center for Orphaned
Autoimmune Disorders, I am very disappointed you can't come!  I was
working hard on a "theme"!  It was going to be fun, not stuffy!  We were
planning to wear clothing appropriate to the theme!  If you can get a
break in your schedule, PLEASE let me know!!!  Especially, I wanted you
there for the press announcement!  I wanted you to make it!!!..I guess
for positive political reasons.
I had so many humorous experiences while working on establishing the
Center.  One with Mardi Gras beads.  I didn't know one had to flash to
get the beads!  I learned more on "sex" than the political system on
that day in the Capitol!  Stupid me, I asked for gold beads in an
elevator!!!  Everyone was wearing them. They had a good laugh at my
expense! I had GOLD beads to give you at the celebration!!!!
Take care.  I believe you will do what you think is best for the Board! 
One can't ask for more!
I am always there to serve in your behalf, wherever, if at times for
only a prayer!

Gov. Bush,
In an email last week you asked me why Bay District (like others) are or
could have a budget crunching year.  Here is a few items from our budget
office here in Bay County.

Total increase in funding			$ 4,092,018
	For Bay County the increase is 3.29% per FTE

   *Categorical*
	School Recognition 			- 1,112,223
	Teacher Retention/Bonus	-   643,723
	Instructional material		-   202,875
	Prorated holdback 00-01		-   590,480
	Growth funding				-   362,585

NET INCREASE					$ 1,125,391

Therefore, the "discretionary" funding increase is less than 1%

Jeb, don't get me wrong... we in Bay County will "make it", but the fact
as I see it is an increase of less than 1% .

As you know, we are in the budget preparation stage (as a Board) now. I
will keep you posted.

After stating all that,  I GLAD YOUR MY GOVERNOR AND THAT YOU ARE
RUNNING AND WILL CAPTURE ANOTHER TERM.  You are truly doing a great job.

Governor Jeb Bush

We apologize for reaching you like this, however we have an emergency
situation and Mary Collins was kind enough to provide us with a direct
contact to you.

I would like to bring to your attention the situation of this young child
who is fighting for his life.

Abel Valencia is a very unfortunate 13 year old from Colombia who came to
our attention in March 1999 following a syncopal episode.  A thorough
investigation showed that he had Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve,
which caused a severe impairment of the function of the right ventricle
causing severe heart failure.  He underwent right atrial reduction and
tricuspid valvuloplasty in 1999, but soon after surgery he rapidly developed
again worsening of heart failure and ascites with a protein-loosing
enteropathy.  Since then, his condition has been gradually deteriorating.  

In May 2001 he had two strokes and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation
and he had some thrombi in the heart.  He has also developed thrombosis of
the radial artery.  After appropriate anticoagulation, he underwent again
open heart surgery to try to improve his condition.

After surgery, he had a persistent bleeding and he was required to be taken
back to the operating room where he experienced a prolonged cardiac arrest
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and because of the poor cardiac
function he was placed on a mechanical pump.

Abel today underwent orthotopic heart transplant, which was the only option
to keep him alive.  He is currently in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, at
Jackson Memorial Hospital.

Abel will require long term medical care and medications to prevent the
rejection of his new heart.  The initial applications to the Children's
Medical Service and Florida Medicaid were rejected because of the lack of
immigration papers.  I kindly ask if there is any way that we can help this
unfortunate child, who has already been through so much at this young age.

Thank you for your immediate assistance to this matter. Please feel free to
contact me for any further information.  


Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Schindler: 

Thank you for emailing Governor Bush concerning a possible increase in the age to obtain a driver's license. The Governor has asked that I respond to you directly.  

I spoke with the Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles Executive Director Fred Dickinson concerning your question. The good news for Truddie and unfortunately, the bad news for your nerves is the age to obtain a driver's license continues to be 16 years of age.  Mr. Dickinson stated this is one of those "urban legends" that make the rounds at the end of every school year. 

Thank you again for writing Governor Bush.  I hope this information will be helpful to you.  Please do not hesitate to contact the Governor or me with any other concerns you may have.

I'm really happy Connie Mack was appointed to the USF board. He is such a

The rest of the board are very illustrious and talented as well. Most are
USF alumni who have already proven they care about USF. I have two sons at
USF and so this new board is of great interest to me. Just hope they do
something about student parking and about lack of computer science classes!

Only thing that bothers me is there are only two Hispanics and one African
American out of the 13 members. I just wish there had been a little more

Governor Bush:
     I must admit you have a lot of people in the community of Tampa upset
about your most recent appointees to USF's board.  The complaint is that you
did not appoint enough people with a legitimate background in education.
Then the one person that you did appoint is not from the South.  Then I have
heard some complaints about one Hispanic and one African-American  Honestly,
I think that they are really upset with the fact that you appointed 12
republicans to the board.  I have researched other colleges in the North and
their boards consist of people who truly understand fiduciary
responsibility. I believe that the community of Tampa will calm down once
the new board of trustees become active in the University's procedures and
processes all of this will be forgotten, yet please be very careful of the
when you do your appointing for Florida A&M University's board of trustees.
I don't think they will allow you much rest with the appointing of 12
republicans.   I wouldn't want some of these up and coming politicians to
use that board as a springboard to their political career.  I believe you
are doing what's best for Florida's Educational and University system.  I

these changes may be best for Florida's future.  Do what you must for the

Dear Jeb: 

For approximately a month and a half, I have been trying to get the 
Scheduling Office to give me a date for you to attend the grand opening and 
USA kickoff for Telefonica-Data USA in Miami-Dade County.  As you are 
probably aware, Telefonica is one of the world's largest corporations and has 
an eighty-five (85%) percent saturation in Spain and South America.  Their 
annual revenues are in the 10's of billions and they are launching their 
American operations at the Lightspeed Center (formerly known as Beacon 
Tradeport).  As a part of their plan and announcement, as an example, Lycos 
will be announcing the relocation of their North American corporate 
headquarters from New York (together with all of their employees) to the 
Telefonica facilities in Miami-Dade.  Hewlett Packard will also be making 
major relocations, and your attendance at their opening and USA kickoff is 
very important to them. 

In fact, Cesar Alierta, the Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of 
Telefonica Worldwide (from Spain) intends to attend as does the Chief 
Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard, if you are willing to participate.   
This high-tech commitment will be like no other in Florida or anywhere in 
America.  The plan also includes many other South American relocations to 
these data facilities. 

We were unable to get a commitment for June or July on your schedule and they 
are now proposing Wednesday, September 19 as a preferred new date well in 
advance, in order to try and secure your commitment.  Mr. Alierta is a 
substantial international figure that will bring significant credibility and 
recognition for what is taking place in Florida and under your agenda, and I 
know you will recognize this.   

I need to get back to the principals in Spain and other places very quickly, 
and I would appreciate it if you could encourage your staff to approve this 
time on your schedule.  They would be looking for you to participate in a 
morning press conference and a noontime lunch meeting, which will be full of 
telecom executives from throughout the world.  This is a major coup for you 
and your administration.  I can have full briefing materials made available 
as you may request. 

Thanks for considering this request.

Subject:	RE: Wilderness preservation in central Florida

Governor:

Here is some additional information.  Rebecca Eagan summarizes this
acquisition fairly.  

Given the formula in Florida Forever, we have less funds available for
acquisition.  Given this we have ranked projects in two categories; 'A' and
'B'.  This project is ranked a 'B'.  The 'B' ranking is due mostly to the
size of the parcel and the assessed value of more than $33M in comparison to
the 'A' projects that have been ranked.  We beleive we can make other
statewide priority acquisitions in the near term.  However, there are
incentives for the partners in acquisition to make it a higher priority
(amount of funds contributed, conveyance of title, etc.).  For this
particular property there is also an opporunity through a lease ammendment
with property leasees to acquire this parcel should the opportunity to

Thanks Rebecca. I understand now. This is because of the P-2000 money going
to the Everglades restoration instead of general revenue. Next year, Florida
Forever monies will be available. I will look into this purchase.

Hi, Gov. Bush! Sorry, didn't realize you weren't privy to the specifics;
Yesterday's Orlando Sentinel main editorial was about the Holland Ranch
project as well as a recent in depth article co-written by Christine Shenot
(cshenot@orlandosentinel.com).  But basically the state, along with the St.
John's Water Management District were set to purchase this property
bordering the Econlocahatchee headwaters which would for all ecological
reasons be beneficial---but this deal fell through and/or was abandoned in
favor of some other acquisition(s) in Florida due to the budget shortfalls
in the Florida Forever fund you mentioned because that money that was MEANT
to be earmarked for the environment was distributed to other sectors by the
legislature.
Mark Glisson---I guess in your absence---was put in contact with me and
intricately explained to me that this project was downgraded to "B" from "A"
because the money for everything was not there. "B", he says means it is not
top priority anymore for purchase, whereas "A" meant it WAS. He says they
re-evaluate the "contenders" for the 'A' list in October, so it isn't "dead"
yet. For all the reasons explained in the Sentinel article the Econ is a
very important to preserve from intensive development, not the least of
which is that it is a flood-prone zone (in Hurricane Donna the whole area
was under water for miles.)
Anyway, I think most environmental people here agree this is a critical
preservation hotpoint---because a developer as we speak is ready to move in
on that property and the realtor thinks it's great. If you can't get access
to them,. I will send you the pertinent Sentinel articles.
I suppose the importance of the Econ can't be perceived from a distance, and
maybe Central Florida seems already lost to growth:  but it ISN't entirely;
and we would love to see some of what is left saved.
Thank you for responding. I know your priorities are many, and I can only
imagine how difficult it is to address EVERYBODY's  concerns. This one
really isn't such a parochial one as it may appear from
Tallahassee---Buffering a main river's headwaters is so crucial.
Sincerely,
Rebecca

Pam, 

In case you did not see the news on Nabi, attached is our press release from
yesterday that I believe is great news for Florida business.  We announced
the sale of the majority of our plasma collection business to an Australian
company, CSL.  This brings Australian investment into Florida which Nabi
will use to further the development of our pipeline and our pharmaceutical
business.  The new company will establish a headquarters in South Florida
and I am sure that there will be additional growth possibilities in the
state from them.  Between the two companies nearly all of our more than 1850
people will be employed making this a great win win for the companies and
the State.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Congratulations on the rebranding announcement for the state and Enterprise
Florida.  Sorry that I was not able to be at the introduction in Tampa.

Dave.

in his case.  He is asking that his death sentence be carried out "as
expeditiously as possible."  

On June 5, I sent a letter to Janet Keels asking her to initiate a clemency
investigation, which includes having clemency counsel appointed to represent
Mr. Trease.  In Mr. Trease's letter, he specifically states that he does not
want clemency counsel appointed and he is waiving his right to appear at any
stage of the clemency process. He sent a copy of this letter to Janet Keels
as well.

How would you like to proceed under these circumstances?  A background
investigation can be completed without cooperation from the inmate.

What a shame....
I realize that this and my previous E-mail did not go directly to the Governor. I understand from inside sources that several people are responsible for the responses that we average citizens get from this E address. But, I was hoping that this avenue would enable me to move forward with my desire to serve the people of my community and state.
It's been almost 3 months since this original correspondence and I am still waiting for some kind of direction. Commissioner Crist's office sent me a nice note, but nothing since. I have attended 2 separate functions recently that both the Governor and Lt. Governor were at as well. I heard them speak about children needing safe learning environments, but I don't understand why someone like me is not being offered the opportunity to volunteer my efforts.
While I agree that Resource Officers are needed to combat this problem, I think parent involvement may be even more crucial. Wouldn't it be better if we addressed the real issues of violent youths instead of standing prepared with a bandaid
when the situation explodes onto our campuses? Schools cannot begin to teach literacy skills to Little Johnny while he is concerned about getting shot in the hall. Parents must be a part of the answer.
The response I got from my original E-mail led me to believe that I had connected with the right offices/people. I was fired up and ready to go.... what happened?

Roxanna, thank you for your email. The state is proactive in its approach to school safety issues but there is more that we can do. 
 
My personal belief is that we should expand the school resource officer concept as the first, best way to deal with school violence. The use of police officers in schools is the ultimate form of community policing. HOtlines, counseling, prevention education, assessment activities are being done throughout the state. Again, we should always strive to do better.
 
I am passing on your email to Commissioner Charlie Crist so that he can get you involved in the safety efforts in some way. Charlie is a leader in this policy area.

As a multi-generation Floridian who is proud of her heritage, and our state, I write to you with a heavy heart for our children.
Last school year, there were more than 180,000 reports of crime and violence in Florida schools. My own personal experience has been at a High School where we lost a student to gun violence in our student parking lot. Our usually quiet community was rocked and still bears the scars of lost innocence and security shaken. 
I am proud to say that as a school family, we are healing and moving on. However, our own tragic experience and the reported numbers tell us that we must be pro-active in preventing the kind of pain that our community endured.
What steps are being taken through your office to address today's school safety issues? Having lived the nightmare, it is important to me to know that we are moving in a direction that will facilitate safe learning environments for the children of our state. I also ask not only what your office is doing, but what can I personally do to be a part of the solution. I believe that ultimately, my unsolicited education with our own crisis happened in my life for a reason. I would welcome the opportunity to be a constructive force in providing my own children and others the means to attend school without fear.
                                         Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for your courage in signing the "All

decision and applaud your wisdom in responding to the
needs of the patients and physicians of the State of
Florida.

We have previously contacted your office to request

September.  Knowing that your schedule constantly
changes, I understand that you have not been able to
give us a firm answer at this time.

Let me make the invitation personal and urge you to

physicians of the State of Florida a wonderful
opportunity to express face to face our gratitude for
your decision to sign the "All Products" Bill.

Dear Governor Bush: 
 
Attached, you will find letters regarding Dr. Henry W. Hanff, in regard to whom our issues go back to 1987, and as indicated, the matter ties in to the University of South Florida.  
 
There will be more on this in the near future, probably in the form of a formal complaint against Dr. Hanff with the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) which appears to be the appropriate venue for some, but not all, of our issues of concern.  Hopefully, AHCA will have enough muscle to involve other state entities as necessary.  Cindy Schlesinger, of AHCA, was kind enough to provide me with the appropriate complaint form and some information that has been helpful.

Ms. Elizabeth M. Ferrera
Director of Appointments
Governor¹s Appointment Office
Room LL08, The Capitol
Tallahassee, FL  32399-0001

Dear Ms. Ferrera,

    I am delighted to have the opportunity to support the nomination of Mrs.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Latiff to the Board of Trustees of the University of
Florida.  I have known Betsy for more than 25 years, initially as a neighbor
and subsequently as a friend during which time I had the opportunity to see
her raise a family and simultaneously engage herself in numerous activities
for the benefit of others.

    Betsy is an extremely charismatic, engaging and young, in spirit, woman.
She is extremely energetic and exhibits remarkable leadership qualities.
While I could spend considerable time detailing her many accomplishments, I
would rather focus on her efforts in furthering research on Sjorgren¹s
syndrome.  She is a co-founder of the National Sjorgren¹s Syndrome
Association.  Her early efforts began more than a decade ago to create
recognition of this disease as well as research programs to determine the
mechanism and treatment of this disease.  It required a dedication and
enormous expenditure of energy to accomplish her goals.  Although she met
many disappointments, it appeared that there was nothing that would deter
her in reaching these goals.  Aside from her efforts in founding the
National Sjorgren¹s Syndrome Association, she has served on a number of
boards and associations dealing with this disease.  She has given testimony
before the Surgeon General¹s Commission on orphan diseases.  She has been a
delegate and invited speaker at many national and international meetings
relating to Sjorgren¹s syndrome and other orphan diseases.  I should add
that she has established a close and positive relationship with the Colleges
of Medicine and Dentistry of the University of Florida and has established
and provided support for new programs that address the disease.  The
establishment of an autoimmune center at the University of Florida which has
received substantial state funding support is one of the many significant
outcomes of her efforts.

    Betsy¹s interaction with the National Institutes of Health and the many
federal and state offices has given her an understanding and ability to work
within governmental framework.  She is the type of person who works well
with others and seems to always bring out the best in people.

    As a final note, I would like to point out that Ms. Latiff and her
family have close ties to the University of Florida.  She is a graduate of
the university.  Her father, also a graduate, was the first environmental
engineer.  Her grandfather taught at the University of Florida and has a
building named after him.

    I am certain that as a member of the Board of Trustees of the University
of Florida she would make a very distinct contribution and help further the
goals of this great university.  In all candor, I cannot think of a more
suitable individual to assume this important undertaking.


Most sincerely yours,

Ms. Tamargo:

According to Tim Ackley, Chief Information Officer at the Florida Online
High School, teacher/student interaction is an integral part of the courses,
just as in a traditional school, and this is why enrollment is limited.
Unlike some University online classes, where the only communication is an
occasional e-mail, the teachers and students of FOHS communicate frequently,
by telephone and e-mail, and develop relationships similar to those found at
a traditional high school. In this respect, an online teacher is similar to
a traditional teacher in that they must personalize their courses and
provide additional assistance to students' needs and concerns. Although the
curriculum is transmitted via the internet, there still must be a teacher to
assist students with the learning process. As with traditional teachers,
adding online teachers to bear the load of additional students is costly to
the school.

It appears that as currently structured this online school functions very
much like a traditional school when it comes to summer school.

You raise a very good point which our education team will discuss.

I hope this helps.

Dear Mrs. Schindler: 

Thank you for emailing Governor Bush concerning a possible increase in the age to obtain a driver's license. The Governor has asked that I respond to you directly.  

I spoke with the Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles Executive Director Fred Dickinson concerning your question. The good news for Truddie and unfortunately, the bad news for your nerves is the age to obtain a driver's license continues to be 16 years of age.  Mr. Dickinson stated this is one of those "urban legends" that make the rounds at the end of every school year. 

Thank you again for writing Governor Bush.  I hope this information will be helpful to you.  Please do not hesitate to contact the Governor or me with any other concerns you may have.

Subject:	A child with a new heart needs help

Governor Jeb Bush

We apologize for reaching you like this, however we have an emergency
situation and Mary Collins was kind enough to provide us with a direct
contact to you.

I would like to bring to your attention the situation of this young child
who is fighting for his life.

Abel Valencia is a very unfortunate 13 year old from Colombia who came to
our attention in March 1999 following a syncopal episode.  A thorough
investigation showed that he had Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve,
which caused a severe impairment of the function of the right ventricle
causing severe heart failure.  He underwent right atrial reduction and
tricuspid valvuloplasty in 1999, but soon after surgery he rapidly developed
again worsening of heart failure and ascites with a protein-loosing
enteropathy.  Since then, his condition has been gradually deteriorating.  

In May 2001 he had two strokes and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation
and he had some thrombi in the heart.  He has also developed thrombosis of
the radial artery.  After appropriate anticoagulation, he underwent again
open heart surgery to try to improve his condition.

After surgery, he had a persistent bleeding and he was required to be taken
back to the operating room where he experienced a prolonged cardiac arrest
requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and because of the poor cardiac
function he was placed on a mechanical pump.

Abel today underwent orthotopic heart transplant, which was the only option
to keep him alive.  He is currently in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, at
Jackson Memorial Hospital.

Abel will require long term medical care and medications to prevent the
rejection of his new heart.  The initial applications to the Children's
Medical Service and Florida Medicaid were rejected because of the lack of
immigration papers.  I kindly ask if there is any way that we can help this
unfortunate child, who has already been through so much at this young age.

Thank you for your immediate assistance to this matter. Please feel free to
contact me for any further information.  


Sincerely yours,

I'm really happy Connie Mack was appointed to the USF board. He is such a
great person and seems to be very nice as well and I especially like what he
is doing for cancer research. I hope I get to meet him one day.

The rest of the board are very illustrious and talented as well. Most are
USF alumni who have already proven they care about USF. I have two sons at
USF and so this new board is of great interest to me. Just hope they do
something about student parking and about lack of computer science classes!

Only thing that bothers me is there are only two Hispanics and one African
American out of the 13 members. I just wish there had been a little more
diversity so that the student body, which is extremely diverse, could see
people like them represented on the board.

The student president, Mike Griffith, is a fine young man. He went to
Sickles High School!

Saw your schedule for today and I got tired just reading it! Don't know how
you keep up the pace.

Governor Bush:
     I must admit you have a lot of people in the community of Tampa upset
about your most recent appointees to USF's board.  The complaint is that you
did not appoint enough people with a legitimate background in education.
Then the one person that you did appoint is not from the South.  Then I have
heard some complaints about one Hispanic and one African-American  Honestly,
I think that they are really upset with the fact that you appointed 12
republicans to the board.  I have researched other colleges in the North and
their boards consist of people who truly understand fiduciary
responsibility. I believe that the community of Tampa will calm down once
the new board of trustees become active in the University's procedures and
processes all of this will be forgotten, yet please be very careful of the
when you do your appointing for Florida A&M University's board of trustees.
I don't think they will allow you much rest with the appointing of 12
republicans.   I wouldn't want some of these up and coming politicians to
use that board as a springboard to their political career.  I believe you
are doing what's best for Florida's Educational and University system.  I
know you have the state's best interest at heart. I also understand that
these changes may be best for Florida's future.  Do what you must for the
advancement of Florida.  Just be aware of the traditionalist who do not want
to pick up the pace.

Dear Jeb: 

For approximately a month and a half, I have been trying to get the 
Scheduling Office to give me a date for you to attend the grand opening and 
USA kickoff for Telefonica-Data USA in Miami-Dade County.  As you are 
probably aware, Telefonica is one of the world's largest corporations and has 
an eighty-five (85%) percent saturation in Spain and South America.  Their 
annual revenues are in the 10's of billions and they are launching their 
American operations at the Lightspeed Center (formerly known as Beacon 
Tradeport).  As a part of their plan and announcement, as an example, Lycos 
will be announcing the relocation of their North American corporate 
headquarters from New York (together with all of their employees) to the 
Telefonica facilities in Miami-Dade.  Hewlett Packard will also be making 
major relocations, and your attendance at their opening and USA kickoff is 
very important to them. 

In fact, Cesar Alierta, the Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of 
Telefonica Worldwide (from Spain) intends to attend as does the Chief 
Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard, if you are willing to participate.   
This high-tech commitment will be like no other in Florida or anywhere in 
America.  The plan also includes many other South American relocations to 
these data facilities. 

We were unable to get a commitment for June or July on your schedule and they 
are now proposing Wednesday, September 19 as a preferred new date well in 
advance, in order to try and secure your commitment.  Mr. Alierta is a 
substantial international figure that will bring significant credibility and 
recognition for what is taking place in Florida and under your agenda, and I 
know you will recognize this.   

I need to get back to the principals in Spain and other places very quickly, 
and I would appreciate it if you could encourage your staff to approve this 
time on your schedule.  They would be looking for you to participate in a 
morning press conference and a noontime lunch meeting, which will be full of 
telecom executives from throughout the world.  This is a major coup for you 
and your administration.  I can have full briefing materials made available 
as you may request. 

Thanks for considering this request.

Katie, here are our estimates for the Florida impacts of what Congress passed.  Please note that these are preliminary numbers.  Our own estimates will change some as we get a more complete understanding about the administrative details of the federal changes.  Also, be aware that other people may also be working on estimates that may go public.  Nevertheless, I think that these estimates are certainly in the ball park and tell a reasonably accurate story as to the effects on Florida.

If you have any questions call Jerry Bowman on my staff at 922-5152.  Also, make sure to touch base with Donna if you want to go public with these.

I would like a list of twenty or so, hispanic men and women to serve on
boards and commissions from Broward,  Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa. These
should be people who are not serving right now. We are not doing enough. Can
you guys do a little outreach and come up with these names in the next two

Pam,

Linda Wilson suggested I contact you.  I am the President of H.A.B.A., 
Hispanic American Business Association.  H.A.B.A., in conjunction with the 
National Sport Shooting Foundation (N.S.S.F.), would like to present to the 
Govenor, gun locks for the entire State of Florida.

The "Home Safe" Program would provide 5000 gun locks for big city Police 
Departments, down to 200 gun locks for the smallest Police Departments or 
Sheriff Departments, for the entire State of Florida.

We would like to do this in Jacksonville, in conjunction with the Governor's

trip on July 27th.  Please call me to discuss.  We think that this would be 
an exciting project for the Govenor to do.

Very truly yours,

Dear Jeb: 

For approximately a month and a half, I have been trying to get the 
Scheduling Office to give me a date for you to attend the grand opening and 
USA kickoff for Telefonica-Data USA in Miami-Dade County.  As you are 
probably aware, Telefonica is one of the world's largest corporations and has 
an eighty-five (85%) percent saturation in Spain and South America.  Their 
annual revenues are in the 10's of billions and they are launching their 
American operations at the Lightspeed Center (formerly known as Beacon 
Tradeport).  As a part of their plan and announcement, as an example, Lycos 
will be announcing the relocation of their North American corporate 
headquarters from New York (together with all of their employees) to the 
Telefonica facilities in Miami-Dade.  Hewlett Packard will also be making 
major relocations, and your attendance at their opening and USA kickoff is 
very important to them. 

In fact, Cesar Alierta, the Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of 
Telefonica Worldwide (from Spain) intends to attend as does the Chief 
Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard, if you are willing to participate.   
This high-tech commitment will be like no other in Florida or anywhere in 
America.  The plan also includes many other South American relocations to 
these data facilities. 

We were unable to get a commitment for June or July on your schedule and they 
are now proposing Wednesday, September 19 as a preferred new date well in 
advance, in order to try and secure your commitment.  Mr. Alierta is a 
substantial international figure that will bring significant credibility and 
recognition for what is taking place in Florida and under your agenda, and I 
know you will recognize this.   

I need to get back to the principals in Spain and other places very quickly, 
and I would appreciate it if you could encourage your staff to approve this 
time on your schedule.  They would be looking for you to participate in a 
morning press conference and a noontime lunch meeting, which will be full of 
telecom executives from throughout the world.  This is a major coup for you 
and your administration.  I can have full briefing materials made available 
as you may request. 

Thanks for considering this request.

Dear Governor Bush,

	As a long time resident of Leon County and someone who has been
actively involved in this community, I understand that you face a difficult
decision--appointing someone to complete the unexpired term of suspended
County Commissioner Rudy Maloy.  Having given this issue much consideration,
it is with full confidence that I pass on to you my recommendation of Ms.
Emily Fritz.  I have known Emily for years and have had the pleasure of
working with her through Leadership Tallahassee on numerous projects.  She
is a true lead who cares about this community and would represent Leon
County well.  Emily is not a perennial politician, but someone who has given
careful consideration to this task and is willing to step up and meet it.
Leon County and Florida would be well-served by her appointment.

	Thank you for your attention to this correspondence.

Jeb:

Great job so far on university trustees.

It is my understanding Florida State is coming up.  In
my opinion, you cannot find a man (or woman) of higher
moral fortitude and character within Florida than
applicant Ken van Assenderp.

He has the ability to improve the working relationship
between FSU and FAMU.  He was a key player in
establishing the funding for the joint engineering
college between the two.  As Chairman of the Freedom
Fund Banquet, he was instrumental in obtaining Andrew
Young of Atlanta as featured speaker and draw.

Ken was the one and ONLY "independent" wisely chosen
to serve on the Florida Election Reform Commission
earlier this year, and he is the only non-Republican I
know that I would recommend for a Gubernatorial
appointment.

I strongly support Ken van Assenderp for one of the
Florida State Trustee spots.

I was sorry to receive my expected phone call today from your office. I had 
been advised as to my situation earlier so it was expected, but disappointing 
nonetheless. I wish the selected members the best in their endeavors and hope 
they have the energy and insight required to make all this happen. 

I remain very interested in serving on the FSU board so I can do my part to 
make this a successful endeavor. There are so many linkages that can be 
fostered with the right effort and enthusiasm. I hope you look upon this 
favorably. 

Best of luck at the press conference tomorrow.

Timothy J. Keegan community activist and chair of the Biscayne Shores Community Council has 
put forth yet another site for the Florida Marlin's stadium.  The proposed stadium location, not in his community council district, is the former Munisport/Interama.  A 75-acre toxic waste dump, the site is centrally located near Sunny Isles, North Miami Beach and North Miami and is adjacent to Florida International University north campus.
 
Keegan says the plan to have the stadium in the city of Miami is fundamentally flawed and is being driven by political considerations not by attendance and economic factors.  Keegan sees this site as an attractive alternative that takes into consideration the teams existing fan base in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

CONFIDENTIAL TO BOARD MEMBERS OF COAST TO COAST RAIL


 


Good Morning, Dear Members:

 
I must congratulate you on your timing!  By acting so swiftly, we are going to get a possible double-whammy in the press for Florida High Speed Rail! Pam and I have spent the day faxing our High Speed Rail Investment Act Resolution to EVERY major daily in the state—not blindly, but we have learned the lead transportation reporter (some we know), lead business editor (some we know) and editorial page editor (well, we know one) of the BIG NINE papers and have faxed personalized copies to each and every one of them. We are also at work getting this out, of course, to our Congressional delegation, at which this baby is aimed. 
 
(Of course, BIGGEST BLUE LEADER in Tallahassee got the very first copy, so he could be up to speed and out front as he should be, in whichever way he chooses. He got not just one, but two, emails laying the groundwork yesterday and Steve is sending a probably fantastic letter tomorrow, by fax, formally requesting his active support.) 
 
Our distribution list runs wide and deep, so I wouldn’t advise trying to send a fax here right now, because Pam is jamming these out, each one personalized, as fast as a perfect Executive Assistant can.
 
HOWEVER, NOW READ THIS! The U.S. House version of the HSRIA (remember this is already under consideration in the U.S. Senate) is to be introduced on WEDNESDAY, JUNE 27, i.e., this week, and not only are you INVITED TO ATTEND, but Amtrak plans to do a major press release announcing our support for HSRIA AGAIN two days from now. And just about half of you are MENTIONED in the release! (I’m working for as many as I can get in!)
 
Now, nobody, go tell Amtrak, please, I have to maintain these relationships so that I can pull off these kinds of things for us and the benefit of Central Florida: I have “cut and pasted” below a draft of the press release sent me for review to make sure they don’t make any really big mistakes. I could not resist providing you, confidentially, please, an advance copy of that release as soon as it reached my hot, little hands. I highly recommend you read it because Coast to Coast is almost the “centerpiece” of the release. (And get any mistakes to me ASAP!)
 
So, I don’t know whether we’ll get press for our cause tomorrow or Thursday or both, plus the editorial page editors have all this time to mull things over and then write editorials on SUNDAYS and in the weeks ahead. 
 
AMTRAK is the primary beneficiary of this legislation as it stands, but there are some on the Congressional Transportation panels (including a fairly influential Floridian) who might amend the Act to make it available to private investors and wouldn’t that suit BIGGEST BLUE LEADER in Tallahassee just fine: 80% federal or, possibly 80% federally-backed private investment, giving the state a 20% or, possibly less, opportunity to invest (leaving more funds available for other priorities as determined by he and the Legislature).
 
Well, anyway, AMTRAK is so pickled that they have invited any or all of you to attend the introduction and lend your support of the House companion HSRIA on Wednesday. That’s pretty short notice, but if you’re going to Washington anyway or if you might be interested in flying up for this, please call me and I’ll get the details. I can’t possibly make the trip because I will probably still be faxing this Resolution out to State legislators and have about ten major projects or products to work on or get out. (Sorry to any of you feeling neglected, but this has been important.)
 
BELOW YOU WILL FIND THE SECRET DRAFT AMTRAK PRESS RELEASE & far, far below that you will find the scoop on what’s going on in DC straight from an Amtrak Washington lobbyist!!!
 
I’d rewrite it for you, but it’s pretty clear and it’s late again, and, tomorrow, there is all this faxing, emailing and letter writing, including the paperwork needed to convince our newest member to actually join us.
 
Happy reading and God bless you and America,
Travis
 
P.S. I can’t do all these format tricks to entice your readership unless YOUR computer is SET UP to receive HMTL email (I’m not naming names). If it is NOT, then I must switch to “plain text” which is really boring and hard to wade through—but, really Pam can’t keep taking all these “delivery failures” and then “cutting and pasting” my work into her own special message for “plain text” readers, well, she can’t do it FOREVER. 
 
(If you are receiving emails consistently from “Coast2Pam2” and not, well, you know me, THEN we are having DELIVERY FAILURE problems and either you can have your trusty assistant fix your computer right or ALL OF US will have to read boring “PLAIN TEXT.” If there is a system incapacity, and there may well be, then we will change so everyone get the messages THE FIRST TIME—in “plain text.”
 
If you are receiving pure HMTL, you may note that Amtrak uses different colors in the release. Well, so you don’t even have take two seconds to figure it out, I’ll just say I believe they are sending out “customized” press releases for each state in which they find support for HSRIA (and, possibly, private investors, but don’t tell them that).

FINAL DRAFT

6/25/01  2:00 pm
 

BILL IN CONGRESS COULD FUND 80% OF


FLORIDA HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROGRAM

 
            Leading members of Congress today introduced the High Speed Rail Investment Act (HSRIA), which could cover up to 80 percent of the cost of Florida’s high-speed rail program. 
            No state stands to benefit more from HSRIA than Florida, where voters last November approved a constitutional amendment mandating that construction start on a statewide high-speed rail network by the end of 2003. Gov. Jeb Bush earlier this month signed legislation creating a Florida High-Speed Rail Authority to designate the system by next January. On Monday, a coalition of 34 major central Florida employers—including Bank of America, Walt Disney World, SunTrust and Universal Studios-called on the state’s Congressional delegation to support the passage of the HSRIA.
            The bipartisan legislation, (H.R.xxxx) introduced by Reps. Amo Houghton (R-NY), James Oberstar (D-MN) and XX other cosponsors, will provide an alternative to congested airports and highways, create jobs and economic opportunities, and respond to the demands from 38 states, dozens of local governments, and Chambers of Commerce for more federal support of passenger rail. 
“Today, almost all of our national travel burden is carried by aviation and highways, when a healthier and more efficient balance could be struck in many communities with the development of passenger rail,” said Amtrak President and CEO George D. Warrington. “For relatively modest investment in high-speed passenger rail, we can get more ‘bang for the buck’ while we try to ease the congestion that threatens our mobility and quality of life. We commend Representatives Houghton and Oberstar and the other members of Congress who are championing this bill, and we look forward to working with them to enact it.”    
 

Florida High-Speed Rail

The development of a Florida high-speed rail system has focused initially on the Interstate 4 Corridor between Tampa Bay and Orlando, with subsequent extensions to Miami, Jacksonville and Naples. The Tampa Bay-Orlando route would run down the median of I-4.
Coast-to-Coast Rail, a consortium of major central Florida employers, transportation authorities and economic development groups from Port Canaveral to St. Petersburg, endorsed the HSRIA Monday, noting how the potential 80 percent federal contribution could minimize the use of state funds. Coast-to-Coast members include Bank of America, Disney, Verizon, Universal Studios, SunTrust, Sea World and the Chambers of Commerce for Orlando, Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Kissimmee/Osceola County and Orlando’s I-Drive Resort Area [Travis here, I am working on Tampa Bay and Space Coast here.]
The plan also has strong support from organizers behind Tampa-Orlando’s bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympic games.
 

Broad, Bipartisan Support at the State, Local and National Levels 

At a Capitol Hill press conference, the bill’s sponsors noted the growing momentum behind the proposal. The Senate companion bill (S. 250), sponsored by Senators Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), has 55 cosponsors, including Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS).  Similar legislation offered by Houghton and Oberstar in the last Congress was approved by the full House of Representatives, while a companion measure in the Senate was supported by 67 Senators.    
            Strong support for rail is also demonstrated by growing levels of state funding.  Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have invested more than $850 million in intercity rail projects since 1996.  Thirty-eight states and the District support continued development of high-speed rail corridors.
   

Federal Funds Would Leverage State and Private Investment 

The bill would authorize bond financing of up to $12 billion over 10 years, with the proceeds going to upgrade existing rails, build new high-speed lines, purchase high-speed trains, and eliminate or improve grade crossings.  States would be required to match 20 percent of project costs in order to obtain funding in their regions. States now must provide financing on a 50-50 basis or in some cases are forced to pick up the entire cost because of the absence of federal funding.  The state matching funds would be placed in a privately managed escrow account to guarantee repayment of the bond principal.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost of the $12 billion bond program to be $4.3 billion over ten years. 
            

Legislation Fits Into Long-Term Capital Investment Plan

            The bond bill, if enacted, would also finance some of the needs identified by Amtrak in its 20-year capital investment plan, which recommended that the federal government invest an average of $1.5 billion per year in the national passenger rail system.  Amtrak now receives less than $0.6 billion.  Specific needs and potential benefits are spelled out in the plan, which is posted on the Internet at  <http://www.amtrak.com/news> www.amtrak.com/news.  
More than two-thirds of the proposed investment would be spent outside of the Northeast Corridor in other high-traffic corridors, including Florida, California, the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest with Chicago as the hub, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, and Texas.  None of the investment funds would be eligible to be used to cover Amtrak’s day-to-day operating expenses.    
Amtrak’s guests enjoy satisfaction-guaranteed service throughout a 22,000-mile network in more than 500 communities and 45 states.  For more information, including schedules, fares and reservations, visit Amtrak’s award-winning web site at www.amtrak.com.

This is really terrific.  It will absolutely help and I really appreciate all your effort to get this done.  I know it's not easy to herd 35 CEO's and even harder sometimes to get what you need when from US!  So, thanks for your persistence.  [Travis, here: I didn’t say “herd,” I said “negotiate” (see below this).]
 
Here's is the first update for you on action:
 
1) The House bill will be introduced on Wednesday at 2:00 in Room 2167 Rayburn by Reps Oberstar and Houghton.  They are welcoming supporters to attend, and, in fact, if there was any chance you could have someone present, they are likely to acknowledge Coast2Coast has having endorsed the legislation.  Even better, if you could have a high profile person there, the members might like to have him or her speak as a representative of the business community.  Just let me know what you think might be possible.
 
Also, we are hoping to have 100 cosponsors of the House bill in time for introduction on Wed.  We are at 82, so any help you can give in having calls go into Florida delegation members in the next 24 hours would be great. [I’ll call Mica, Shaw and Foley; can any of you help, please?]
 
2)  The Senate Finance Committee has said that they intend to hold a hearing on July 11.  This has not been officially put on the calendar, but we are prepping for it.  I'll keep you informed.  
 
Thanks again for your support.

Great job so far on university trustees.

It is my understanding Florida State is coming up.  In
my opinion, you cannot find a man (or woman) of higher
moral fortitude and character within Florida than
applicant Ken van Assenderp.

He has the ability to improve the working relationship
between FSU and FAMU.  He was a key player in
establishing the funding for the joint engineering
college between the two.  As Chairman of the Freedom
Fund Banquet, he was instrumental in obtaining Andrew
Young of Atlanta as featured speaker and draw.

Ken was the one and ONLY "independent" wisely chosen
to serve on the Florida Election Reform Commission
earlier this year, and he is the only non-Republican I
know that I would recommend for a Gubernatorial
appointment.

I strongly support Ken van Assenderp for one of the
Florida State Trustee spots.

A 75-acre toxic waste dump, the site is centrally located near Sunny Isles, North Miami Beach and North Miami and is adjacent to Florida International University north campus.
 
Keegan says the plan to have the stadium in the city of Miami is fundamentally flawed and is being driven by political considerations not by attendance and economic factors.  Keegan sees this site as an attractive alternative that takes into consideration the teams existing fan base in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

Based on this experience, Emily has demonstrated a strong interest in issues directly affecting the citizens of Leon County. Additionally, Emily's ability to emerge as a leader, to grasp the critical elements of an issue, and to weight viewpoints in a fair manner; assures that she would effectively represent the interest of her constituents.

Dear Jeb, 
 
I forgot to mention a head’s up and a tip.
 
1.	Monday, we will issue a Resolution encouraging the Florida Congressional delegation to do everything in its power to support the High Speed Rail Investment Act. We know it’s a $4B tax revenue drain on the Treasury, but after a lot of debate, we figure Amtrak will compete with private investors if HSR goes anywhere (and I do know the realistic odds on that, Jeb) and if Florida gets some benefit out of 80% essentially federal funding, it’s worth it.
 
            Hell, I’ll just insert the latest version and you can read it in advance for yourself. Some pretty powerful Board, well, Executive Committee members             wanted to issue a separate Resolution to encourage your support. I argued that the best way to get you to study the issue, as I know you will, was not a Resolution             you read in the press about you, but through a letter from Steve with a copy of the Resolution. Am I right or am I right? I won.
 
2.	The tip: We sent a letter endorsing five Board members and Senator Sebesta (at his personal request to me) for the new HSR Authority. Aside from the Senate Transportation Chairman who wants an even more “direct hand” in matters, the ONE to look at, if you are, in fact, still looking, is Heidi Eddins, EVP and GC of the FEC (well, FECI). She dealt with high speed rail in the Northeast Corridor as GC of the only freight rail line that operates on Amtrak-owned tracks from electrification for Metroliner through the introduction of Acela, the train proposed for Florida (150 mph at about $13M/mile-a LOT cheaper than FOX or, obviously mag-lev). She knows this stuff cold and is one savvy woman with some great degrees. I spent a lot of time with Vice Chair Bob Mac Swain and Heidi discussing any potential conflict—we figured that HSR is going to get anywhere near the FEC for years, if at all, to put it short.
 
Thanks, Jeb.
 
As always,
Travis

American operations at the Lightspeed Center (formerly known as Beacon 
Tradeport).  As a part of their plan and announcement, as an example, Lycos 
will be announcing the relocation of their North American corporate 
headquarters from New York (together with all of their employees) to the 
Telefonica facilities in Miami-Dade.  Hewlett Packard will also be making 
major relocations, and your attendance at their opening and USA kickoff is 
very important to them. 

In fact, Cesar Alierta, the Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of 
Telefonica Worldwide (from Spain) intends to attend as does the Chief 
Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard, if you are willing to participate.   
This high-tech commitment will be like no other in Florida or anywhere in 
America.  The plan also includes many other South American relocations to 
these data facilities. 

We were unable to get a commitment for June or July on your schedule and they 
are now proposing Wednesday, September 19 as a preferred new date well in 
advance, in order to try and secure your commitment.  Mr. Alierta is a 
substantial international figure that will bring significant credibility and 
recognition for what is taking place in Florida and under your agenda, and I 
know you will recognize this.   

I need to get back to the principals in Spain and other places very quickly, 
and I would appreciate it if you could encourage your staff to approve this 
time on your schedule.  They would be looking for you to participate in a 
morning press conference and a noontime lunch meeting, which will be full of 
telecom executives from throughout the world.  This is a major coup for you 
and your administration.  I can have full briefing materials made available 
as you may request. 

Thanks for considering this request.

Dear Jeb: 

For approximately a month and a half, I have been trying to get the

Dear Jeb,                 
 
Here is the final resolution I mentioned. You’ll be getting a very nice letter from Steve asking you to consider and support the HSRIA. If you haven’t already, I’d get someone in OPB to take a look at S. 250 so you’ll get any you might want, should this be of any interest to you at all. I just have to do the letter shortly. The Resolution is going to every major paper, reporters and editorial page editors around the state as I write.
 
Thank you, Travis

Again, if you need me to send you the news clipping about this, let me know.
Christine Shenot (Sentinel writer) wrote that there is a county commission
meeting on the Holland Ranch purchase on July 10---that the county is still
looking at creative ways to help with the purchase for preservation
purposes.  Maybe there is still hope:  State and County managing a viable
deal?         Rebecca   PS Christine says plenty of people have weighed in
with her about saving this property after her article appeared.

I am writing in support of Emily Fritz for the position of Leon County Commissioner to replace Rudy Malloy. I have had the opportunity to work with Emily through Leadership Tallahassee.  Based on this experience, Emily has demonstrated a strong interest in issues directly affecting the citizens of Leon County. Additionally, Emily's ability to emerge as a leader, to grasp the critical elements of an issue, and to weight viewpoints in a fair manner; assures that she would effectively represent the interest of her constituents.

Hi, Gov. Bush! Sorry, didn't realize you weren't privy to the specifics;
Yesterday's Orlando Sentinel main editorial was about the Holland Ranch
project as well as a recent in depth article co-written by Christine Shenot
(cshenot@orlandosentinel.com).  But basically the state, along with the St.
John's Water Management District were set to purchase this property
bordering the Econlocahatchee headwaters which would for all ecological
reasons be beneficial---but this deal fell through and/or was abandoned in
favor of some other acquisition(s) in Florida due to the budget shortfalls
in the Florida Forever fund you mentioned because that money that was MEANT
to be earmarked for the environment was distributed to other sectors by the
legislature.
Mark Glisson---I guess in your absence---was put in contact with me and
intricately explained to me that this project was downgraded to "B" from "A"
because the money for everything was not there. "B", he says means it is not
top priority anymore for purchase, whereas "A" meant it WAS. He says they
re-evaluate the "contenders" for the 'A' list in October, so it isn't "dead"
yet. For all the reasons explained in the Sentinel article the Econ is a
very important to preserve from intensive development, not the least of
which is that it is a flood-prone zone (in Hurricane Donna the whole area
was under water for miles.)
Anyway, I think most environmental people here agree this is a critical
preservation hotpoint---because a developer as we speak is ready to move in
on that property and the realtor thinks it's great. If you can't get access
to them,. I will send you the pertinent Sentinel articles.
I suppose the importance of the Econ can't be perceived from a distance, and
maybe Central Florida seems already lost to growth:  but it ISN't entirely;
and we would love to see some of what is left saved.
Thank you for responding. I know your priorities are many, and I can only
imagine how difficult it is to address EVERYBODY's  concerns. This one
really isn't such a parochial one as it may appear from
Tallahassee---Buffering a main river's headwaters is so crucial.

Governor: 
Attached is a revised FSU potential list. Please note that Bob Naegele does not want to be considered for FSU. 

<<Florida State University.doc>> 

Can you review the list and let me know your preferences -- by this afternoon? As of now, the FSU announcement is set for 10 a.m. Wednesday.

Let me know if you need more information on any of the potentials. I am available in the office at 488.4512  or on my cell anytime at 850.508.4387.

Talk to you soon! 

-- Lauren 
  

PS -- I added a new applicant to this list: Victor Rivers, an FSU graduate who served on Bobby Bowden's first season at FSU. he was drafted by the Miami Dolphins as a free agent, making his the first Cuban-American to receive the opportunity.  He is originally from Miami (Miami Coral Park High School, ''73) and serves as national spokesman for the National Network to End Domestic Violence. He is a prolific actor, resident of California now and a 1977 FSU graduated (BS,, criminology). His answers to the education questionnaire in the application are thoughtful and show he understands the role of the Board of Trustees. 

His name was not previously on the short list for FSU, but as a Hispanic male, he is worth considering.

Dear Governor Bush, 
    My name is Lynda Thabes and I am a member of the Florida Developmental 
Disabilities Council. I have 4 children, the oldest of which has Down 
syndrome (Selena, age 6). As a member of the Education Planning Work Group 
which is a sub-committee of the Council's Education Task Force, I wanted to 
let you know how exciting it is to hear of your new seven-member Florida 
Board of Education. This gives so much promise to improving Florida's 
education system and increasing the efficiency and success rate of our 
educating our children! It is my understanding that Dr. Bill Proctor has 
experience with exceptional student education - I am also wondering, is there 
an interest in or plans for parental input (i.e., a parental advisory 
committee) in some capacity? As a person who seems to have a genuine interest 
in disability issues, I'm sure you know that this aspect of our education 
system poses some unique considerations that might otherwise be overlooked 
without a means to call attention to them. Wouldn't it be helpful to the 
Board of Education to have perspective from those who actually have to 
navigate this system? This could provide valuable insight on both the 
negatives which need to be addressed as well as the positives which are every 
bit as important and should also be highlighted. I would be very interested 
in knowing your opinion on this subject. 
    In closing, let me offer a sincere thank-you for my appointment to the 
DD Council. I have learned so much in such a short period of time and I find 
it both energizing and humbling to be associated with such a dynamic, 
compassionate group of individuals. I appreciate the opportunity to work with 
them in an effort to better the lives of not only my daughter (who, I will 
add, is doing splendidly) but disabled persons throughout this wonderful 
state. 
    I will look forward to your reply. 

Most Sincerely, 
Lynda Thabes, DVM

Subject: Correctional Privatization Commission appointments


Jeb: 

The Correctional Privatization Commission regulates the five private prisons 
in Florida.  Our firm represents Corrections Corporation of America (CCA).   
CCA operates three facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission:  a 
750-bed prison to house adult males in Bay County, a 350-bed facility to 
house male youthful offenders in Columbia County, and a 896-bed prison to 
house medium security females in Gadsden County.   

The Commission consists of five members.  By statute, four of the members 
must be from the private sector and may be from within state government.  My 
understanding is that all of the Commissioners' terms expire today.  There 
have been only four members of the Commission for some time because Don Mills 
left state government and his seat on the Commission has not been filled.   
One other member has not regularly attended meetings. 

The five facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission are well run.   
There have been no major incidents at any of them as far as I know.  The 
facilities are run with an emphasis on drug treatment and education 
programming. 

The purpose of this note is to ask you to put the Commission on your radar 
screen for the appointment process.  If I can provide you with any more 
information about the Commission or about the CCA facilities that operate 
under its control, please give me a call at 224-5081.

Senator Graham,
This should be renamed, "The Trial Lawyers Bill of Rights". I want to tell you a very short story. I was Foreperson of a jury in a civil case a few short years ago.  Since I was management of a large and wealthy company, it is amazing that I even made it to the jury. Nonetheless, there were three defendants and one of them was the Department of Transportation. In less than 20 minutes, our jury found all three defendants not guilty. Do you know what one jury member said? "Since the D.O.T. has a lot of money, let's find them guilty and give the plaintiff a few mill?" Do you believe that? It didn't happen, thanks to the rest of us. But just what do you Democrats think is going to happen if you don't cap these punitive damages? This is South Florida, Senator. You're from here. For goodness sake, lawyers advertise on billboards!  Employers will cease offering health plans, HMO"s will run ( I have one and they're wonderful), and premiums will go sky high. All because of your precious lawyers? Don't ever tell us again the President Bush is in anyone's pocket.
Yours truly,

Dear Sir 
My son Angel Brioso is in Leon County Jail, Tallahassee, Capital of Florida 
State 
The last march 1th the hispanic inmate Angel Brioso was assaulted and Raped 
by two inmates in Leon County Jail in Tallahassee City ,Florida. The victim 
had been descriminated for his poor English By a couple inmates and also by 
two officers in the Jail. 

By That date (more than 140 days) the inmate has been raped by the Burocracy 
of the system because he has not recived any medical care or Psichological 
Attention In his Origin language. 

In all this time his family has asked by the internet to spanish counslers 
to try to help the inmate by phone. 

Since march 1th the Jail authorities have him 24 hours seperated from the 
rest of the population in the Jail In an area called suicide watch because a 
few months a go another inmate killed himself.In this area they dont have 
tv,radio,newspapers vision outside or any other activity,Its like a Hole 
My son Angel Brioso has been encarcelated for over 120 days and he hasn't 
had adequate medical care. as of up to this point he has not received 
phycology evaluations. 
On june 13 , 2001 I visited him and his emotional status scares me, for his 
life. 
He's confine to Suicide unit , alone with light all times, without any 
physical contact except for correction officers, hasn't seen light sun in 
over 100 days. he is actually depresed since he can't fight the idea he was 
raped. 
I have solisited to transfered to South Florida, and it has not been taken 
into consideration or heard. 
I also requested mental attention in spanish and has not be heard or taken to 
consideration. 
He's only received from Priscilla Burnes from Refuge House, but she cannot 
help him more due to languages rales. 
My son finds himself in a hole with not outcome and for 10 months they have 
not rendered a contact visit from us the family. 
One again I request for your prompt attention and cooperation. Please hear 
and help this umfornate mother pleading for help 
In this great country you are innocent till proven guilty. Till this moment 
my son is innocent and if anything he did was an error, he's paid it with 
physical mark in his body for life and shame. 
We do understand that if he's incorporated with the other  inmate he's a 
target for predators but a better solution can be used if he is transfered to 
a South Florida Jail and receives the mental help he needs, for his rape. 
I'm once again here pleading to please continue the investigations since, 
they'll answered you he gets the assistant, but he does not have it. Get 
someone to go in person to see his stage of mental instability and emotional 
distrees his in, loosing 10 kg of weight, also condition of living, please 
dont ask to the jail autorities, ask to him he have the real true about the 
jail. 
Once again I want to appreciate all you help and hard effort to help this 
mother and my two grandson in crisis,also wife, father ,brother and all 
family. 
Now that the judge denied the pettition the family and more than 100 
associations arround the country are asking for an investigation to office of 
the governor of florida, Jeb Bush. 
The state of florida has a big poppulation of hispanics the hispanic vote was 
inportant for the last presidential elections but now a hispanic inmate in 
tallahassee is very sick,alone in a hole far away from his family and without 
addecuated medical care.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Thank you for responding to the previous email I sent from work.  To evade 
prying eyes, I'm responding from home.  You must be weary of hearing from me 
by now. 

What we wish to visit with you about is a matter that is uncomfortable not 
only for us but for every one who has been affected by it one way or another: 
the impact of sex offender laws on an offender's family. 

If you are cringing right now, you are not alone.  It isn't easy discussing 
such a subject amongst peers much less to someone of your stature.  It is 
embarrassing and humiliating.  Please, don't turn a deaf ear, but rather 
allow us to bring to the forefront issues that many would rather ignore and 
brush under the rug.  You govern a state of approximately 16 million people 
--many of them citizens, many aliens, many foreigners and many who have made 
mistakes in their lives -- but people who are all affected by your leadership 
nonetheless. 

You may recall getting emails from my wife and I about three years ago in the 
early stages of our dependency case.  And, even in the midst of frustration, 
we understood why you could not involve yourself.  This time, we are not 
coming to you to referee a personal legal case, but to speak up on behalf of 
many families who have, in a sense, become an underclass due to aggressive 
and often harsh laws aimed at one family member but that affects the entire 
family, including innocent children and spouses. 

What happened to Megan Kanka was a horrible tragedy, as was what happened to 
Jimmy Ryce.  I have three children, ages 4, 12 and 18, and I pray that we 
never have to live through the nightmare that the parents of these kids had 
to live through.  More importantly, I pray that nothing like that ever 
happens to one of my kids.  I applaud the Kanka's and the Ryce's for their 
vigilant endeavors to appeal to our law makers and push for legislation to 
protect minors from true sexual deviants who would prey upon them -- deviants 
that truly define the term 'predator'.  I'm afraid, though, that in the midst 
of grief, pain and anger, emotions - not common sense - ruled when all of the 
registration and notification laws were enacted, especially when Bill Clinton 
threatened the states with loss of funds from Washington if each did not put 
a registration and notification system into place.  It goes without fail to 
say that money was a major motive that literally drove legislators across the 
nation to hastily and carelessly pass laws with no thought given as to the 
downside to hundreds of thousands of innocent families across this great land 
built upon the principle of 'justice for ALL'.  And, while several states 
have excercised restraint and used a more compassionate approach with the 
notification process, others have trampled all over the rights of spouses and 
children of offenders with, it would appear, a seared conscience.  And, while 
some states have successfully put into place a 3-tier system as a measure 
against being over-zealous with registration and notification procedures, 
other states have digressed to the age of the scarlet letter.  And, yes, I 
know there are debates about a 3-tier system (high risk, moderate risk, low 
risk) because many of those branded as high or moderate feel they have been 
wrongfully categorized.  I do know that the system has proven to be 
successful as it is still in effect in several states.  And, while Florida 
seemingly places a distinction between a sexual predator and a sex offender, 
it is done in such a way that the line of seperation is very blurred which 
puts everyone into the unjust category of 'unredeemable'.  In Florida, a man 
or woman who may expose himself or herself to a minor while in a drunken 
stupor is lumped together with those who are so demented as to rape a minor 
-- not in sentencing, but in being paraded before the public like a sideshow 
in the form of community notification as a sex offender.   

Yes, there are sexual predators and, yes, there are repeat offenders...but, 
there are also minor, isolated incidences that do not merit the deafening cry 
of "Sex Offender" being echoed across every community in America with 
innocent people getting caught in the crossfire.  Governor, I have observed 
you govern and conclude that you are a man or wisdom and reason.  If there is 
one thing that can be said about President Bush and yourself is that both of 
you stick by your guns, so to speak.  Never in my life have I seen two 
leaders who are so passionate about what they believe to be right and moral, 
and I commend both of you for having such thick skin and strong character.   
As well, you tout the principles of the family and marriage as institutions 
established by God, if not in words then in actions.  Therefore, I have to 
believe that you would want ALL children to be protected -- not ostricized -- 
by the laws of our nation and this state. 

May I just cite a few incidents of vigilantism against individuals labled as 
sex offenders and their families that we have read about or heard of: 

*the case in New Jersey of a man labled as a sex offender -- someone went to 
his home and, without any thought or consideration of who might be inside, 
began firing gunshots through his window; who could have justified this had a 
child inside been killed by one of the bullets? 

*a female sex offender in California who had her photo posted publicly -- all 
four of her children were harrassed at school by other students - one of the 
children was beaten so severely that he had to be hospitalized! 

*two men who set a man's home on fire because flyers were given out to his 
neighbors -- what if his family had been home and asleep? 

*another man who was jumped by a group of men and beaten up -- what had his 
kids been with him at the time?  what might have happened to them? 

There are other instances, but just the above should make anyone shudder.   
There have been those who call this "sacrifice for the greater good", but has 
our society really become so calloused and cold that many are willing to 
write off entire families because of a frenzy fed by hysteria and, at times, 
bad politics??????  It is the sign of a Godless nation.  Consider even more 
deeply, Governor, when the offense was minor in nature, and the offender and 
victim have been reunited by the same court system that is supposed to 
protect the victim without stopping short of the goal, as has been our case.   
What if the media reveals the identity of a minor victim of a sexual offense 
and the family has no means to bring civil action against them as was a case 
here in your state?  What if, because the victim's parent is plastered all 
over the community and the victim is harrassed at the bus stop with no 
reprieve from the system that 'set out' to protect the victim but failed to 
follow through when it comes to the constitutionally protected right to 
privacy as the minor victim of a sexual offense?  What, when a family has 
done above and beyond what was ordered by the courts to work through a 
situation and be reunited but, while the family court says "we're making you 
go through years of a step-by-step process because our goal is for you to, 
once again, function as a normal family" but the circuit court and 
corrections say through actions that "we're not going to allow you to 
accomplish that"?  Frustatingly, what does a family do when they're involved 
in both the dependency and circuit courts and neither judge knows what the 
other is doing and a 'judicial conflict of interest' is created?  I tell you, 
sir, these things may very well be what defines (pardon the rhetoric) 'hell 
on earth'. 

Governor Bush, email is so impersonal and very easy to respond to without a 
sense of human connection.  But, I appeal to your sense of family and of 
fairness when I ask you to not take the sum of this email as the whole of 
what lays heavy upon our hearts, especially that of my dear wife's, but to 
allow us to have audience with you for a time to capture the heartbeat of a 
man who knows what it means to have personal family matters broadcast to the 
masses when there was no harm to be done to anyone except those you love 
most.  I made a mistake 4 1/2 years ago, Governor - a bad judgement call - 
but I am still a husband and a dad who wants to shield and protect my family 
from the scourge of the public just as you desire to do for your own.  I do 
not know if the media is alerted to all meetings you have with citizens; if 
so, I would not wish you any more reproach by having the papers blare 
'Florida's Governor Socializes With Sex Offender', nor would I wish to 
subject my family to further reproach in such a manner.  If you would feel 
uncomfortable in my presence, will you at least allow my wife to have the 
opportunity to meet with you and speak from her heart about the importance of 
at least considering some changes to the laws governing sex offenders so as 
to lighten the load and alleviate the scorn forcefully thrust upon so many 
innocent families, including children with some of those being the victims?   
Even if everything remains status quo after it's all said and done, we wish 
the opportunity to be heard for the sake of our own children and thousands of 
others who are negatively affected, just as the Kanka's and Ryce's were 
allowed to be heard for just causes dear to their hearts and rightfully so.   
I realize we are only two of millions who would enjoy the privilege of a 
face-to-face chat with you, but I boldly bring my request before you with a 
sense of urgency.  We await your response. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my email.  May God richly bless you and 
yours. 

Respectfully Yours, 
Steven Shaver 

PS: Thanks for running for Governor again (wish I could vote) -- the thought 
of Janet Reno at the helm of the ship is enough to send chills down one's 
spine!

I do not expect that the statutory language will be struck down before we
file. A constitutional challenge to proviso should not be precluded simply
because there is a related--but not identical--provision in substantive law.
Of course, if we challenge this proviso, the point you make may be raised
against our challenge. On balance, I think we should feel comfortable
proceeding on this issue because of the differences between the proviso and
the statutory provision.

Yes, I think we should proceed with our planned challenge to this proviso.
There are two reasons: (1)there is at least some chance the statutory
provision will be struck down in a single subject challenge; (2)this sort of
free floating substantive legislation in an appropriations act is so
blatantly unconstitutional that it demands a challenge.

That's our thinking on this right now.  Let me know if you want us to do
something different.  Following are more details which you need not read
unless you are searching for a cure for insomnia.

                    *****************************************

Some background on the difference between the proviso and the statutory
provision: the provision in the statute is narrower than the proviso.  The
proviso purports to guarantee admission at  state medical schools for
military academy students who have qualified for the medical corps.  The
statutory provison specifically limits the special right of admission to two
applicants annually for each medical school.

Some more background: the statutory provision was passed after the proviso.
Under the general rules of statutory construction, where two measures
address the same subject the "last passed" will govern. Here that means the
narrower statutory provision should trump the proviso. If that were the end
of the story, it might not be necessary to include the proviso in our suit.
But because the statutory provision may be struck down in a single subject
challenge, challenging the proviso makes sense.

Good morning.  Well, I got a bit misquoted in the Orlando Sentinel about
the University of Florida going to court.  I did receive a phone call this
morning from Joe Little, a professor in the Law School whose area of
expertise is constitutional law.  He agrees with you that the "Spinelli
amendment" is unconstitutional.  He gave me some  of the reasons, but they
were pretty foreign to me.  I genuinely appreciate your concern over this
issue, and the dangerous precedent it sets.
As you might imagine, several members of the press have asked about the
discrepancy between doing away with affirmative action to assist the
underprivileged while enacting law to assist the privileged.  They have
also asked whether or not I thought this represented the kind of
micromanagement of universities by the legislature that was feared with
abolishment of the BOR.  I gave no opinions on either, but it is important
to be aware that this is the kind of issue that someone might try to use in
the future.
Good luck trying to get it repealed, or whatever.  It may represent an
opportunity to take the high ground.  As for me, I have been asked/told to
stay out of it.
Best,
Bob Watson

Governor: 

Sorry to email you this, but I need your feedback directly: 

We've partnered with Arvida/St. Joe to develop several charter schools 
across Florida in new home communities, including Southwood in Tallahassee, 
next to the new FSU Lab School.  Because the Lab School will primarily 
continue to hold its current population, there's a need for new student 
stations for the new homes (something Arvida believes the district would 
support).  Arvida is planning some attractive ways to value add and create 
incentives for their residents. 

I also understand that the state offices located there house some 5-6,000 
employees.  The question is: would you support, in concept, the school 
setting aside 50% of the seats (we expect to ultimately have 1600 seats, 
k-12) for state employees' children on site.  We could do this under the 
statute's charter-in-the-workplace provisions, similar to Ryder's set aside. 
The remaining seats would be for the homeowners and community at large, 
including others outside Southwood.  We would also like to name the school, 
The Governor's Academy. 

If you are at least open to this, could I set up a brief call w/you to 
discuss further what this would entail, etc. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush, 
    My name is Lynda Thabes and I am a member of the Florida Developmental 
Disabilities Council. I have 4 children, the oldest of which has Down 
syndrome (Selena, age 6). As a member of the Education Planning Work Group 
which is a sub-committee of the Council's Education Task Force, I wanted to 
let you know how exciting it is to hear of your new seven-member Florida 
Board of Education. This gives so much promise to improving Florida's 
education system and increasing the efficiency and success rate of our 
educating our children! It is my understanding that Dr. Bill Proctor has 
experience with exceptional student education - I am also wondering, is there 
an interest in or plans for parental input (i.e., a parental advisory 
committee) in some capacity? As a person who seems to have a genuine interest 
in disability issues, I'm sure you know that this aspect of our education 
system poses some unique considerations that might otherwise be overlooked 
without a means to call attention to them. Wouldn't it be helpful to the 
Board of Education to have perspective from those who actually have to 
navigate this system? This could provide valuable insight on both the 
negatives which need to be addressed as well as the positives which are every 
bit as important and should also be highlighted. I would be very interested 
in knowing your opinion on this subject. 
    In closing, let me offer a sincere thank-you for my appointment to the 
DD Council. I have learned so much in such a short period of time and I find 
it both energizing and humbling to be associated with such a dynamic, 
compassionate group of individuals. I appreciate the opportunity to work with 
them in an effort to better the lives of not only my daughter (who, I will 
add, is doing splendidly) but disabled persons throughout this wonderful 
state. 
    I will look forward to your reply. 

Most Sincerely, 
Lynda Thabes, DVM

Dear Kevin: 

Governor Bush forwarded your email to me for response regarding the education governance reorganization legislation. The bill is available online at On-line Sunshine, the legislature's website. I have included a link to the page( http://199.44.49.2/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session <http://199.44.49.2/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&Submenu=1&FT=D&File=sb1162er.html&Directory=session/2001/Senate/bills/billtext/html/> &Submenu=1&FT=D&File=sb1162er.html&Directory=session/2001/Senate/bills/billtext/html/) containing the bill text (Senate Bill 1162). 

The press releases announcing the Governor's appointees to the Florida Board of Education and each state university board are available on-line as well (link attached) They contain brief bios on the appointees.

Governor Bush: 
     Ms. Shoaf sent me the information on internship opportunities with the 
Capitol, unfortunately they are not paid internships they are for college 
credit. I graduated three years ago and I am in the working class.  I am 
seeking something full-time.  I am trying to pay of my student loans in the 
near future to make my self eligible for a home within the next two to three 
years.  An unpaid internship at this time would not be a step in that 
direction.  I do appreciate the thought.  Also, I read in the newspaper 
about the new appointees and the new education bill.  Could you tell me 
where I can find out more about the bill, plus a more in depth background on 
your new appointees.  Thank you.

Dear Gov, Bush:   I thank you for your thoughtful reply and I sense your
concern is genuine. As I told Mr. Glisson, only we who have intimately known
and loved  our natural Florida for years can preserve it; We can't expect
newcomers to avidly  wish to save something they've never experienced.  This
issue is so NONPARTISAN, really....we all stand to gain or lose according to
what we save or let fall through the cracks forever.  We once had Bachman's
warbler---but now , since 1963, no one will ever again hear its song. I find
this loss grievous, in part because we could be driving to extinction other
species NOW, inadvertently. Well, anyway---I DO see your position. And I
agree that a healthy economy matters. I know your job is a fractured
balancing act. Thank you for all you do, and for your alertness to the
problems.   Sincerely,
Rebecca       PS  We need to upgrade the Holland Ranch/Econ headwaters
project back to "A":  Today's Orlando Sentinel  editorial is about precisely
this. This is the content, also, of the bulk of my communication with Mark
Glisson.

Governor: 

Sorry to email you this, but I need your feedback directly: 

We've partnered with Arvida/St. Joe to develop several charter schools 
across Florida in new home communities, including Southwood in Tallahassee, 
next to the new FSU Lab School.  Because the Lab School will primarily 
continue to hold its current population, there's a need for new student 
stations for the new homes (something Arvida believes the district would 
support).  Arvida is planning some attractive ways to value add and create 
incentives for their residents. 

I also understand that the state offices located there house some 5-6,000 
employees.  The question is: would you support, in concept, the school 
setting aside 50% of the seats (we expect to ultimately have 1600 seats, 
k-12) for state employees' children on site.  We could do this under the 
statute's charter-in-the-workplace provisions, similar to Ryder's set aside. 
The remaining seats would be for the homeowners and community at large, 
including others outside Southwood.  We would also like to name the school, 
The Governor's Academy. 

If you are at least open to this, could I set up a brief call w/you to 
discuss further what this would entail, etc. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Jeb, 
 
I forgot to mention a head’s up and a tip.
 
1.	Monday, we will issue a Resolution encouraging the Florida Congressional delegation to do everything in its power to support the High Speed Rail Investment Act. We know it’s a $4B tax revenue drain on the Treasury, but after a lot of debate, we figure Amtrak will compete with private investors if HSR goes anywhere (and I do know the realistic odds on that, Jeb) and if Florida gets some benefit out of 80% essentially federal funding, it’s worth it.
 
            Hell, I’ll just insert the latest version and you can read it in advance for yourself. Some pretty powerful Board, well, Executive Committee members             wanted to issue a separate Resolution to encourage your support. I argued that the best way to get you to study the issue, as I know you will, was not a Resolution             you read in the press about you, but through a letter from Steve with a copy of the Resolution. Am I right or am I right? I won.
 
2.	The tip: We sent a letter endorsing five Board members and Senator Sebesta (at his personal request to me) for the new HSR Authority. Aside from the Senate Transportation Chairman who wants an even more “direct hand” in matters, the ONE to look at, if you are, in fact, still looking, is Heidi Eddins, EVP and GC of the FEC (well, FECI). She dealt with high speed rail in the Northeast Corridor as GC of the only freight rail line that operates on Amtrak-owned tracks from electrification for Metroliner through the introduction of Acela, the train proposed for Florida (150 mph at about $13M/mile-a LOT cheaper than FOX or, obviously mag-lev). She knows this stuff cold and is one savvy woman with some great degrees. I spent a lot of time with Vice Chair Bob Mac Swain and Heidi discussing any potential conflict—we figured that HSR is going to get anywhere near the FEC for years, if at all, to put it short.
 
Thanks, Jeb.
 
As always,
Travis

We need a major change in the way we do business. For years we have had a leaderless leader who simply did What Mr. Dickensen told him to do.

Dear Gov, Bush:   I thank you for your thoughtful reply and I sense your
concern is genuine. As I told Mr. Glisson, only we who have intimately known
and loved  our natural Florida for years can preserve it; We can't expect
newcomers to avidly  wish to save something they've never experienced.  This
issue is so NONPARTISAN, really....we all stand to gain or lose according to
what we save or let fall through the cracks forever.  We once had Bachman's
warbler---but now , since 1963, no one will ever again hear its song. I find
this loss grievous, in part because we could be driving to extinction other
species NOW, inadvertently. Well, anyway---I DO see your position. And I
agree that a healthy economy matters. I know your job is a fractured
balancing act. Thank you for all you do, and for your alertness to the
problems.   Sincerely,
Rebecca       PS  We need to upgrade the Holland Ranch/Econ headwaters
project back to "A":  Today's Orlando Sentinel  editorial is about precisely
this. This is the content, also, of the bulk of my communication with Mark
Glisson.

David, you asked me to find out more re who, what, why on the Lake Okeechobee
protestors so you could provide additional information to the governor. I
talked to Joe Schweigart. The marina operators, fishing guides and others who
depend on the lake for business are virtually shut down because of the low
lake levels.  Their message is that they blame the WMD that the lake drawdown
last year has put them in this situation.  They think the drought should be
declared an emergency in their area and they should get economic relief.  Per
Joe they had supported the drawdown last spring but now think differently.
He had no idea how they felt about backpumping and believed you might get
differing opinions within this group.  Joe pointed out that they would be in
nearly as bad a situation now even if they had not drawn down the lake last
year.  The lake would only be about a foot higher now and they would still be
having problems.
 
OTTED held an interagency meeting recently with these Lake Okeechobee
interests.  Secretary Seibert said that the outcome was less than
satisfactory as to what the state could provide re economic relief.  He has
asked his staff to look into this further to determine if there is a way the
state can be more engaged in addressing their problems.

The following is my veto message on the crib bill. I believe that my decision is well thought out. Thank you for writing.
 
Jeb Bush
 
  

June 19, 2001


 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

 

 

The Honorable Katherine Harris

Secretary of State

PL 02, The Capitol

Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0250

 

Dear Secretary Harris:

 

By the authority vested in me as Governor of Florida, under the provisions of Article III, Section 8, of the Constitution of Florida, I do hereby withhold my approval of and transmit to you with my objections, Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856, enacted during the 33rd Session of the Legislature of Florida convened under the Constitution of 1968, during the Regular Session of 2001 and entitled:

 

            An act relating to infant cribs;…

 

Generally, Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 would prohibit commercial users from manufacturing, selling, or leasing unsafe cribs and it would prohibit transient public lodging establishments from offering or providing unsafe cribs.  The bill would provide immunity from civil liability to owners of cribs not intended for infant use if they are properly labeled.  It would also establish a first-degree-misdemeanor penalty for violation of the law and specifies that violation of the law constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice.  Finally, the bill would require the Department of Business and Professional Regulation to inspect all cribs in transient public lodging establishments.  

 

Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 is a well-intentioned effort to increase the safety of infant cribs.  Sadly and tragically, it is estimated that 13,000 children are injured every year in the United States due to injuries from their cribs, and that 35 infants die annually from unsafe cribs.  I fully support the model legislation proposed by the Danny Foundation, an organization dedicated to eliminating unsafe cribs.  The Danny Foundation’s model legislation would make it illegal for a commercial user to sell or place in the stream of commerce an unsafe infant crib.  According to the Foundation, this model legislation has been adopted in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois and Washington state.  

 

If the provisions of Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 which seek to implement the Danny Foundation’s model legislation were before me as a stand-alone bill, I would sign those provisions into law.  However, Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 has additional regulatory provisions relating to transient public lodging establishments that have not been adopted by any other state and are not part of the Danny Foundation’s model legislation.  These additional provisions have several incurable deficiencies that prohibit me from allowing this legislation to become law.   

 

While Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 will not become law, there is much that state government can do short of this legislation that will reduce the risk of injury and death from unsafe cribs in Florida’s lodging establishments.  Because I share the bill proponents’ desire to increase the safety of infant cribs being used in Florida’s lodging establishments, I am directing Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Kim Binkley-Seyer to immediately begin an aggressive educational campaign to provide hotel and motel licensees with infant crib safety information.  Commencing as soon as possible, with every hotel and motel inspection, DBPR inspectors will provide each licensee with the Crib Safety Checklist that I have attached to this veto message.  In addition, DBPR will request that licensees providing cribs to guests also display information in the guest rooms regarding infant crib safety.  We also intend to provide hotel and motel licensees with information regarding placement of the crib in the guest rooms.  Information regarding infant crib safety will be accessible on the Department’s Hotel and Motel Web Page at  http://www.hospitalityeducation.org <http://www.hospitalityeducation.org/> .  The Department will also utilize space in the Florida Hotel and Motel Association Journal to provide the department’s licensees with crib safety information.  And finally, the Department will host a booth at the Florida Hotel Motel Association Trade Show in August, and will distribute crib safety information to the show’s attendees.  Through these public information efforts, we hope to increase infant crib safety in Florida’s hotels and motels.  

 

I believe that these public information efforts will be an effective and practical means of reducing the likelihood of unsafe cribs being provided by Florida’s hotels and motels.  Our ambition is to increase the safety of infant cribs in hotels without suffering the following incurable shortcomings that caused me to veto this legislation.  

 

First, Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 would effectively require that every crib in each of Florida’s lodging establishments be inspected by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation twice each year.  While the industry may welcome this additional regulation, the cost to the taxpayers of the state in the form of the additional resources needed to implement these regulations must also be carefully weighed.  

 

Proponents of Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 have argued that such an additional requirement would not pose much of an additional burden on the Department or its inspectors, noting that the Legislature’s bill analysis did not estimate a fiscal impact to the Department.  However, after closely reviewing the bill’s inspection requirements, I must respectfully disagree with that conclusion.  It now seems clear that, if properly and diligently implemented, the bill could consume an unknown and substantial amount of agency resources and could impede the Department’s ability to perform its other inspection responsibilities.  

 

Consider just one of the many infant crib safety criteria that this bill would require state inspectors to evaluate during their inspections.  Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 includes subsection (4)(b)(3) to section 144 of Chapter 501 of the Florida Statutes.  Proposed subsection (4)(b)(3) would require state inspectors to test every crib in every lodging establishment in Florida to determine whether a mattress can withstand at least a 25-pound upward force from underneath the crib.  Setting up and possibly elevating each and every hotel crib in a manner so that the requisite level of force could be applied from underneath each infant crib promises to be time-consuming and it is presently unknown whether inspection of this standard would require one or two inspectors.  Ordinarily, inspections of public lodging establishments require only a single inspector.  When multiplied by Florida’s 11,827 transient lodging establishments, the extensive nature of the crib inspection could negatively impact public health and safety by seriously impairing the Department’s ability to properly perform its other regulatory functions.  

 

Second, while the additional burdens placed on state government are indeterminately significant, proponents of Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 have been unable to provide any information regarding the number of children that may have been injured in Florida’s lodging establishments due to unsafe cribs.  A May 2001 NBC “Dateline” investigation reported that it could not find a single report of a crib death in a hotel anywhere in the nation.  In fact, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 80 percent of the deaths that involved suffocation or strangulation of babies in cribs occurred in the child’s home as opposed to other locations.  More specifically, in the attached letter dated April 9, 2001, Pamela McDonald of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission stated that a search of the Commission’s records from April 2000 to April 2001 found no records of injury or death resulting from infant cribs in Florida’s hotels and motels.  While I do not interpret this lack of information to mean that a potential problem does not exist, I do believe that it is relevant in determining whether a burdensome new inspection program is the best means to accomplish the shared objective of safer infant cribs in Florida’s lodging establishments.  

 

Third, due to practical realities, enforcement of this bill would not have the intended effectiveness as applied to transient lodging establishments and would lead to a false sense of security that could increase danger to infants.  The reality that Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 does not fully address is that most lodging establishments assemble their cribs only when needed by guests, and then disassemble the cribs after each guest’s use.  Most lodging establishments do not have the storage space to keep cribs assembled all the time and most full-size assembled cribs do not fit through guest room doorways.  In many if not most cases, the various parts of each crib including the frame, the baseboard, the crib sheets and the mattress are not kept together as a single, integrated unit.  

 

Inspections only determine the safety of the crib at a single moment in time.  The same crib that passes inspection today could be reassembled differently the very next day in a manner that would not pass inspection.  For all practical purposes, it would be an entirely different and more dangerous crib than the crib that had one day earlier passed inspection.  The repeated assembly and disassembly of infant cribs required by this practical reality creates a uniquely ineffective enforcement situation that does much to severely weaken the intended benefit of Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856’s regulatory regime as applied to cribs in public lodging establishments. 

 

This shortcoming in and of itself is not as troublesome as the potential increase in danger to children resulting from a parent’s reliance on an ineffective regulatory program.  The unintended yet dangerous consequence of Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 is that parents will be given a very false sense of security about the safety of a particular crib.  Public awareness of the inspection program combined with the inherent ineffectiveness of that program will induce parents into a false and potentially dangerous reliance on the safety of a crib provided them in a hotel.  

 

Fourth, in addition to these deficiencies, Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 would create a new avenue for unnecessary litigation.  Proposed section 501.144 (3)(c) would create a cause of action under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices act against public lodging establishments that offers to a guest a crib that does not meet the specifications contained in the bill, even if no injury occurs.  Because proposed section 501.144 (4)(b)(10) specifies that ill-sized crib sheets are an unsafe crib condition, Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 would create a new, legal cause of action for a parent who had been offered the wrong-sized crib sheet, even if the lodging establishment realized its mistake and provided a properly-fitting sheet prior to its use.  There is ample redress under current law for parents whose children suffer injury caused by an unsafe crib in a lodging establishment.  Parents may currently sue the hotel for negligently offering an unsafe crib and the crib manufacturer for manufacturing and selling the unsafe crib.  Creating a new avenue for lawsuits when no injury has occurred would be an excessive and unwise use of the limited resources of the state’s civil justice system.  

 

In sum, the potential new and unintended dangers created by this bill combined with the lack of data regarding injuries to infants from hotel cribs make it difficult to justify the extensive time-consuming and burdensome regulation this bill would require.  Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856 is a good example of the expression, “Good intentions do not always make good law.”  

 

Finally, I wish to make it very clear that the veto of this bill will not affect the Department of Children and Families’ current practice of inspecting infant cribs in child care facilities.  The Department of Children and Families will continue to inspect infant cribs three times annually for day care facilities, and two times annually for home care facilities.  

 

For the reasons provided above, I am withholding my approval of Committee Substitute for Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 856, and do hereby veto the same.

 

Sincerely,

Rebecca, thank you so much for writing. 

I am very concerned about the unchecked growth across the state. Don't get me wrong, growth is important to allow for people to aspire to prosperity for their families. However, development that does not take into consideration its impact on the commiunity at large and the natural systems that surround us will have a lasting negative impact. 

This year, we proposed a comprehensive reform of our growth management laws to deal with this pressing issue. It did not pass the legislature because of tax issues. However, I intend to push forward administratively and come back to the legislature next year with additional measures. In addition, thanks to Florida Forever, more money will be spent on land in the areas in the path of development so as to protect Wild Florida from being encroached upon.

I really appreciate you concerns about our state. It is a spectacularly beautiful place and we could easily change it for the worse forever unless we change the current land use policies.

Developers here, for the most part, are unconscionable---mowing down
everything (because, I suppose, it's cheaper and easier) alive on huge
tracts of land, and leaving nothing but the soul-less, precictable, hideous
zero lot-line subdivisions, which they love to call charming names like "The
Preserve" or "Heron's Roost", when no bird alive in its right mind would go
within ten miles . Quality of life for ALL here in imperilled, and this is
not the shrill ranting of an extremist. I'm a diehard Republican who voted
for you and for your brother, and who has long admired your highly
UNDERrated father; I know you all are kind and thinking human beings who
think in an individual (not partyline lemming) way:  Therefore, I risk being
brushed under the rug as another Greenpeace nut (which I am FAR from), to
beg you to consider wild Florida---central Florida in particular---in your
future agenda. I was glad you were as appalled as I by the legislature's
stealing from the environmental fund to appease other sectors---this, I
think, was a gross overstepping of their bounds and would seem
unconstitutional.  We need green buffers, sizable ones, pristine lands
preserved, perhaps bought in joint deals with such entities as The Nature
Conservancy, maybe tax incentives for people to keep their land for a while
and manage it themselves, etc.  Only if the issue is seen as
important---urgent,for time IS running out---will solutions be found to
protect wild Florida while we still can. There IS a correlation between
unchecked immigration and environmental destruction, and I KNOW you are
savvy enough to see it.  Well thank you for any bit of my diatribe you take
to heart---you are a persuasive person. Many animals, people, trees and
birds wait with baited breath for your help.  God give you wisdom---and I
hope sincerely you are re-elected.

Governor Bush,

My name is William L. Moor, Jr. and I have applied for the vacancy on the
Leon County Commission.  I want to serve on the Commission because I believe
we need professional business people who are willing to serve in order to
improve the quality of government in our community.  With the support of my
employer, Capital City Bank Group and William G. Smith, Jr., its CEO, I am
able to apply for this position. Capital City is a large financial
institution in the community and the State of Florida and can afford me this
opportunity to serve my community and maintain my current duties and
responsibilities at the bank.

Although there are many applicants for this position, I believe I am
qualified for this position for many reasons.  The commission needs a
business person who understands the economics of both sound fiscal
management and the importance of responsible growth.  My educational
background is in business and is a product of the community and the State.
Locally, I graduated from Leon High School.  I received a Bachelor of
Science in Finance from the University of Florida, and a Masters in Business
Administration from Florida State University.  Currently, I serve on the MBA
Advisory Board for Florida State University.

As a sixth generation Tallahasseean, I care about this community and have
been involved in the community in various organizations.  I am a past chair
of Leadership Tallahassee, the YMCA, the American Heart Association and
LARC.  I have served in several offices with the Tallahassee Downtown
Improvement Authority where I continue on the executive committee working to
improve our downtown center to reduce urban sprawl.  Recently, I was
appointed to serve on the Fee Arbitration Committee for the Second Circuit.
I have served on many committees and boards in various organizations in the
community including the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce.

Leon County needs a commissioner with contacts in other communities around
the state.  We need to open the communication lines with the other
communities to discover new ways of financing growth and learn from the
mistakes of those communities.  In addition, Leon County is not an island,
and needs to have a statewide vision.  At the statewide level I am actively
involved in Leadership Florida, and have served in several positions with
the American Heart Association Florida/Puerto Rico Affiliate where I am
incoming Secretary to the Board.  I am also, a past member of the board for
Community Bankers of Florida, the Florida Bankers Association and served on
the Treasurer of the State of Florida's Public Deposit Advisory Committee.

In closing, I will bring a fresh perspective to local politics.  The
perspective of a business person who has worked for fourteen years in
business in Tallahassee and has been active in the community and the state.
A business person who wants to serve in government to improve our community.
Also, I am willing to run again for commissioner at the end of the term of
office.  Please consider my application for the position.  I would be
honored to answer any questions you have of me.

Mr. Eggert, it these companies were doing something illegal I would agree with you. But tobacco is a legal product. We tax it to the tune of $500 million plus a year. We take their settlement payments to the tune of $420 million a year, including monies to launch our successful anti tobacco campaign. 

We have a responsibility to the 750,000 participants in the Florida Retirement System to avoid political posuturing and get the maximum return at the minimum risk. That may mean not investing in tobacco stocks, but that should be the decision of the professional investment advisors to the retirement system.

Dear Jeb:
 I am aware that it is now the eleventh hour in your consideration of
candidates to appoint to the FAU Board of Trustees,however,I hope you
will be able to give serious consideration to the application of Linda
Cooke which was received by your Appointments Office this morning. I
believe Linda is extremely well-qualified for this appointment for the
following reasons:
1.At the Habilitation Center where she is the Director of Operations,
over the past decade she has transformed what was then nothing more than
a sheltered workshop for developmentally disabled adults into a thriving
high tech assembly plant.When Linda began to work there,the "students"
spent their time stuffing envelopes,coloring and working on
puzzles.Linda believed that they were capable of doing much more than
that and  today under her direction and training  about 250
developmentally disabled adults are assembling cell phones,two way
radios,paging devices and anti-shoplifting devices for such companies as
Motorola and Sensormatic.In addition to overseeing  training and
manufacturing,Linda is also responsible for competitively bidding for
these jobs and she is solely responsible for the profit and loss of the
entire operation.She is an astute businesswoman who knows how to
establish a tight budget and use all of her available resources to get
the job done.Other information about the awards the Hab Center has
received under Linda's management as well as the "Six Sigma" quality
classification assigned to the Center are detailed on her application.
2. Prior to commencing work at the Hab Center,Linda had an extremely
diversified business background where she was responsible for
procurement and contract negotiations for multi-million dollar
companies,e.g., Gould,Inc.,Boeing,General Dynamics and Computer
Products.
3. Linda already has some significant experience with FAU. She recently
worked to complete a conceptual plan for a research/technology center
featuring FAU's College of Engineering, and through Broward Days, she
has established leadership teams to address issues of importance to
FAU,e.g., the I-95 Corridor,expansion of continuing education
programs,the NAP and Internet Coast.Furthermore,as a Director of the
Downtown Fort Lauderdale Rotary Club,she has a vested interest in Rotary
scholarships offered to students for FAU enrollment.

  There are few candidates for this important appointment who have the
breadth of business experience and established contacts with FAU that
Linda Cooke has. I sincerely hope that it is not too late to give
serious consideration to her application.

Subject:	RE: "Spinelli Amendment", SB 1558, specific appropriation 629A

Yes, I think we should proceed with our planned challenge to this proviso.
There are two reasons: (1)there is at least some chance the statutory
provision will be struck down in a single subject challenge; (2)this sort of
free floating substantive legislation in an appropriations act is so
blatantly unconstitutional that it demands a challenge.

That's our thinking on this right now.  Let me know if you want us to do
something different.  Following are more details which you need not read
unless you are searching for a cure for insomnia.

                    *****************************************

Some background on the difference between the proviso and the statutory
provision: the provision in the statute is narrower than the proviso.  The
proviso purports to guarantee admission at  state medical schools for
military academy students who have qualified for the medical corps.  The
statutory provison specifically limits the special right of admission to two
applicants annually for each medical school.

Some more background: the statutory provision was passed after the proviso.
Under the general rules of statutory construction, where two measures
address the same subject the "last passed" will govern. Here that means the
narrower statutory provision should trump the proviso. If that were the end
of the story, it might not be necessary to include the proviso in our suit.
But because the statutory provision may be struck down in a single subject
challenge, challenging the proviso makes sense.

Good morning.  Well, I got a bit misquoted in the Orlando Sentinel about
the University of Florida going to court.  I did receive a phone call this
morning from Joe Little, a professor in the Law School whose area of
expertise is constitutional law.  He agrees with you that the "Spinelli
amendment" is unconstitutional.  He gave me some  of the reasons, but they
were pretty foreign to me.  I genuinely appreciate your concern over this
issue, and the dangerous precedent it sets.
As you might imagine, several members of the press have asked about the
discrepancy between doing away with affirmative action to assist the
underprivileged while enacting law to assist the privileged.  They have
also asked whether or not I thought this represented the kind of
micromanagement of universities by the legislature that was feared with
abolishment of the BOR.  I gave no opinions on either, but it is important
to be aware that this is the kind of issue that someone might try to use in
the future.
Good luck trying to get it repealed, or whatever.  It may represent an
opportunity to take the high ground.  As for me, I have been asked/told to
stay out of it.

Tom Rossin is a partisan democrat. What he ignores is that as trustees of the pension system, we have a responsibility to focus our efforts on getting the maximum return with the minimum risk. This requires not limiting investment for political purposes. 

We continue the anti tobacco campaign and believe that we will see a reduction in teen smoking. That is the best means of expressing our opposition to the use of tobacco.

Governor,
Please consider this note as another reason that billboards should not
blight the highways in South Walton County.  My husband and I are owners
and residents of Walton county.  We moved here because of the natural
beauty found only here.  Please do not mar our countryside will ugly
billboards that do not benefit the citizens.

We are against bill 1053.

Governor,
Undoubtedly you read the editorial in last week's Tampa Tribune regarding
the USF Board of Trustees.  I have come to the decision that, if selected,
my presence of the USF Board of Trustees would provide a press distraction
that would not necessarily be productive for USF or its community goals.  I
am, therefore, requesting that my name be removed from consideration of the
USF Board of Trustees and thank you for the opportunity to apply for this
appointment.
Sincerely,

On another subject, Sen Kennedy of Mass was reported to infer today that had there been a Patient Bill of Rights in place that was to his liking, that maybe this situation might not have taken place of the woman who murdered her 5 children.

Your office might want to make a statement that this type of crime is intolerable in any event, regardless of the so called depression or mental state of an individual.

Jeb Bush - 
 
I don't know how you might want to approach this, or if Brian (and any other members of your staff) will want to discuss it. 
 
I've been asked to submit a package of legislative proposals to a member - regarding taxpayers rights.  We are not going to be the lobby - rather the resource.
 
It seems like a good opportunity to include the bill to restore VAB refunds, which was squashed in recent Session by "that Republican", IN ADDITION TO any and every other place you might want to plant it for passage. That is if you intend such an action. 
 
And, if y'all have an interest in any other suggestions I'm going to make - based upon input from a lot of folks - I'd be glad to review the package with Brian or other members of your staff so they gain insight into what really goes on south of the Bend. 
 
If you are interested, I have two questions. 1) I have not gotten a response from Brian about taking a moment to connect when I'm in Tallahassee next week. Does absence of a response means "yes" or "no"? And, 2) Your bill was sponsored by Senator Crist and Representative Benson. I am sure protocol demands consideration of their involvement if any other sponsor shows up this year. I want to make sure protocol is followed, but in a way that generates a steamroller for your proposal if you opt to bring it back.  The question is about how best to include last year's sponsor's in a package being given to another official.

Dear Jeb,

As the parent of Vincent, age 10 and Joseph, age 9 (who both have
autism)
and a member of the Education Workgroup of the Florida DD Council, thank
you
for appointing the new Board of Education. We plan to attend meetings of
this new board as a guest. I am hopeful that they will work toward
improving
Florida's Education System for ALL KIDS.

My boys attend school in Pasco County and are doing great. However, it
has
taken a major team effort of my family and school personnel to get the
boys
where they are today. We have a friendly collaborative relationship with
the
district!! :)

As the Education & Training Director of the Center for Autism & Related
Disabilities at USF, I continue to be focused on helping to create
positive
changes in education. Please know that I hope to be resource to this new
board in any way possible.

Regards,

Nila Benito

P.S. Karen Clay Moore (Mike's Mom is my best friend) and Carl
Littlefield is
a good friend too! Hope that gives me some credibility.

FLORIDA HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION MAKES $9 MILLION 
AVAILABLE FOR SPECIAL HOUSING PROJECTS


TALLAHASSEE --- The Florida Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC) is making
approximately $9 million available for special housing projects targeted
toward helping farmworkers, the developmentally disabled, and extremely
low-income or homeless Floridians.

"Assisting those in need with affordable housing is one of the most
important things we can do," said Governor Bush.  "This funding will go a
long way toward assisting many of Florida's deserving citizens and families
with the purchase or renovation of a home of their own." 

   Under the specific Request for Proposals (RFPs), available to interested
parties June 22, there will be an estimated $4 million available for
farmworker housing; $2.5 million for housing for the developmentally
disabled; and $2.5 million for housing for extremely low-income and homeless
Floridians. The proposals cover either the new construction or the
rehabilitation of existing housing.

Making funds available through the RFPs is part of an effort to streamline
the process, improving FHFC past procedures, which involved lengthy and
difficult-to-prepare applications.

"It is part of our on-going process to be responsive to specific community
needs," said Mark Kaplan, FHFC executive director.  "We want to encourage
creative input into this process, and we want to help finance the best
housing we can for Floridians." 

Proposals are due back to FHFC by July 20, 2001.  FHFC's Board of Directors
could announce their final funding decisions as early as August.

For a copy of any of the three proposals, contact Steve Auger, contracts
administrator, at (850) 488-4197. They can also be downloaded from FHFC's
website at www.floridahousing.org/rfps.html

Subject: Leon County Commission Selectee


June 21, 2001

Governor:	
On the matter of your selecting a commissioner for the
Leon County Commission, I hesitated sending this note
to you or asking others to do so on my behalf because
I am sure you are aware of me and my credentials in
public service.  It has now occurred to me that you
may perceive this as disinterest, lack of enthusiasm
for the job or a change of heart.  So, for the record,
I would be honored to be the selectee, but more
importantly, I believe my selection would be in the
best interests of the county (government and people)
you, and most importantly, the future of Leon County.
The composition of the present board has wrecked havoc
on county staff, left unsolved problems and strayed
from responsible governing.  Many of the hard fought
battles for conservative outcomes are now at the risk
of coming undone.  The current critical issues facing
Leon County are: executing the spending priorities for
Blueprint 2000 (the penny sales tax initiative for
roads, storm-water and land use); resolving the
property rights issues in Bradfordville; finalizing
the siting of the Transfer Station; developing a
funding scheme for indigent health care; and insuring
that the reapportionment process enhances reelection
possibilities for Republicans in Leon County.  All are
issues that I have worked on and know very well.
Without a strong advocate, well versed in the
arguments, the present deadlock can easily swing to
placate the more liberal element.  
I believe many of the candidates could fill some valid
selection criteria better than I but none is more
qualified.  No one is more philosophically in lock
step with you, being on record as espousing and
working toward smaller government, diverse economic
development, strong property rights and courageous
decision making for the greater good!  I have
withstood much public scrutiny for ideals and have no
problem doing it again to see these goals to fruition.
Your decision in filling this position, I am confident
will be a good one, and as a good soldier, I bow to
your judgment as to the best profile for the
appointee.  I only want to assure you that I would
work diligently to make you and the constituents
comfortable with my selection and Leon County a better
place to live as a result of my efforts.
Thank you for being so accessible. I would welcome the
chance to respond to any questions or concerns you may
have.

Subject: Florida Internet High School Credits & Other Matters


Why is it that Florida High School Internet Classes are so very
limited?  Doesn't it make good sense to allow "unlimited" enrollment;
particularly in the Summer months.  Whether teaching 1 student; or, 1
million students, the set up and maintenance costs are the same.  The
only variable is grading which can , for the most part, be programed.
The present Florida Internet High School offers few; or, no credit
courses during the Summer. I feel defrauded of my tax dollars (close to
$200,000.00 paid for year 2000) when I incur such arbitrary rules that
prohibit our students from achieving and excelling according to their
abilities and speed. I feel sick when I see my hard earned money going
to socialized programs and corrupt organizations.

Let me recommend that Florida Internet High School become an unlimited
and integral part of:  lowering class size, making up credits, advancing
students early to allow seniors who work for the credits to graduate in
December; and, others to have half day senior schedules.  Students who
are sick; or, suspended for a long period of time can also be better
served. Graduating the more advanced students, early, allows for smaller
class size and more individualized teaching directed to the more
academically needy students.  Economically needy students, who finish
early, can then earn some money for college.

For a society that's as advanced as ours, we certainly have some
antiquated methods of teaching; and, wasteful ways of budgeting.  A
classroom should be anywhere that provokes and provides for learning (
any place, any time)!

Which brings me to another suggestion to lower class size and  better
address budgetary woes.  Why are students not allowed to test out of
certain courses via self study; or, home school.  Home school, at this
time, is an either/or option.  Why not allow a combination of:  home
study, self study, etc. and, let the semester final test (same as
public) be the measure.  Again, with more flexibility, we can create
motivation for our students to be more challenged and self reliant;
thus, allowing our high school teachers to spend more time with slow
learners.

It seems that the only education discussions that occur, in Tallahassee,
have nothing to do with teaching children:  to think critically, be goal
directed, self reliant, and enjoy learning.  When it comes to education,
both the R's and the D's are stale and rigid thinkers. What happen to
"educational choices"?  What happen to "performance based budgeting"?
What happen to being "accountable for the highest & best use of taxpayer
dollars"?

We can; and, should be doing  better.............................

Whether it's better education; or, innovative ways to reduce congested
highways, please urge our State Republican leaders to distinguish
themselves by catching up to our vast capabilities of accomplishing
better outcomes through more critical thinking;  use of technology; and,
trusting the taxpayers to make choices.

Governor, unless you and our other Republican leaders in Tallahassee act
in lock step; and, at bullet speed to break the hold of "socialism" ,
we're all going to be doomed.  You've made some inroads; however, they
haven't been in a manner that captivates the majority voter, the "40
hour working man".  How many people understand what you're trying to do
with "One Florida"; or "Career Service", or, "Merit Raises", or,
"Privatization", etc.?  What people do understand is:  "Ten, 20, Life"!
What they will also grasp quickly is your trust in them, via:
telecommuting, flex time, educational choices; and, other means of
saving them money while relieving congestion and stress.  The only
descending thought I've ever heard preventing tele- commuting and flex
time is performance. When the measure of performance is a criteria:  the
employee performs, is put back under the microscope; or, is simply
fired.

Last two questions:  (1)  Why is it that we don't see more of your ideas
implemented through administrative, or executive orders.  (2)  Why is it
that we don't see our three top Republican leaders working together on
more Republican issues, like the ones I've described?  After all, the
three of you were elected with a mandate based on the Republican
message:  less government, better government, more choices, and personal
responsibility!

Hope you and your family are going to be able to enjoy a good old
fashion summer vacation, this year.

As always, best regards, Deb.

p.s.  Our family celebrated our friend Diane Smith's 50th birthday at
the "Brooks & Dunn" sell out concert at the Ice Palace, Saturday night.
Found another good campaign song for you to try out:  "Red, White &
Blue"  or/an altered version.  Not a theme song or video (like "40 Hour
Week"); but, a good warm up song.

p.s.s  It's raining!

public) be the measure.  Again, with more flexibility, we can create
motivation for our students to be more challenged and self reliant;
thus, allowing our high school teachers to spend more time with slow
learners.

It seems that the only education discussions that occur, in Tallahassee,
have nothing to do with teaching children:  to think critically, be goal
directed, self reliant, and enjoy learning.  When it comes to education,
both the R's and the D's are stale and rigid thinkers. What happen to
"educational choices"?  What happen to "performance based budgeting"?
What happen to being "accountable for the highest & best use of taxpayer
dollars"?

We can; and, should be doing  better.............................

Whether it's better education; or, innovative ways to reduce congested
highways, please urge our State Republican leaders to distinguish
themselves by catching up to our vast capabilities of accomplishing
better outcomes through more critical thinking;  use of technology; and,
trusting the taxpayers to make choices.

Governor, unless you and our other Republican leaders in Tallahassee act
in lock step; and, at bullet speed to break the hold of "socialism" ,
we're all going to be doomed.  You've made some inroads; however, they
haven't been in a manner that captivates the majority voter, the "40
hour working man".  How many people understand what you're trying to do
with "One Florida"; or "Career Service", or, "Merit Raises", or,
"Privatization", etc.?  What people do understand is:  "Ten, 20, Life"!
What they will also grasp quickly is your trust in them, via:
telecommuting, flex time, educational choices; and, other means of
saving them money while relieving congestion and stress.  The only
descending thought I've ever heard preventing tele- commuting and flex
time is performance. When the measure of performance is a criteria:  the
employee performs, is put back under the microscope; or, is simply
fired.

Last two questions:  (1)  Why is it that we don't see more of your ideas
implemented through administrative, or executive orders.  (2)  Why is it
that we don't see our three top Republican leaders working together on
more Republican issues, like the ones I've described?  After all, the
three of you were elected with a mandate based on the Republican
message:  less government, better government, more choices, and personal
responsibility!

Hope you and your family are going to be able to enjoy a good old
fashion summer vacation, this year.

As always, best regards, Deb.

p.s.  Our family celebrated our friend Diane Smith's 50th birthday at
the "Brooks & Dunn" sell out concert at the Ice Palace, Saturday night.
Found another good campaign song for you to try out:  "Red, White &
Blue"  or/an altered version.  Not a theme song or video (like "40 Hour
Week"); but, a good warm up song.

Governor:
Yes.  I know a little about this.
Virginia Seacrist has told me she believes an international cement cartel is
working to block the development of cement receiving facilities in Florida's
ports.  She believes if this could be reversed then cheaper cement would be
available in Florida and there would be less need to build new cement plants.
I am fuzzy on the details, but this is her basic line of argument.

Dear Governor Bush,
    You have not heard from me in months, partly because I am now living in
the DC area, right around the corner from Al Gore, and partly because I
thought the Ichetucknee Cement Kiln, and our fight against corruption in the
name of Joe Anderson, was dead.
    Maybe the fight is only dying or perhaps it is resurrected.  I spoke
with
the very knowledgeable and influential businessman who owns the Port of Ft.
Pierce, Lloyd Bell, just yesterday.  He suggests that I contact you, the
governor of the state which uses more cement than any other state.  Mr. Bell
and I, the press, and probably even you know that something is not right in
the cement industry, particularly when Joe Anderson is involved.
    A combination of seemingly unconnected pieces of information lead Mr.
Bell, who has recently returned from Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the
Northwest, to tell me to contact you with the information we have about the
still-perplexing link between the Port of Ft. Pierce and the Ichetucknee
cement kiln.
    Please do not refer me to Benjie Braumberg or even to David Struhs.  In
our opinion, the issue we regard as illegal is of Federal concern, even
international concern.  I would prefer to meet with you.
    I return to Florida monthly to care for my properties, but I am living
near your brother in Arlington, Virginia, so I could meet with you either
place, at your convenience, of course.  In a short phone call, I could alert
you to our concerns (703 684 8598 in Virginia).
    I heard that you seek a second term as Governor of Florida, and that
your
campaign will involve concern about the environment.  Surely the
Ichetucknee/Santa Fe River protection will be important to your election.
    I am involved with the daily care of my two invalid parents, ages 94 and
88, thus I have been away from the care of the rivers in Florida.
    I was delighted with the appointment of Fran Mainella to the head of the
Federal Park System.  Here, I visit the Federally preserved portions of the
Potomac River and try to swim there.

Dear Governor,  
I need your help to get a meeting with Roy Cales.  I would like to brief him
on PRIDE's capabilities.  There are many new IT strategies where PRIDE can
play a roll.  For instance PRIDE has several major contracts with state
agencies to do data conversion, data archiving and data imaging work.  It is
great training for the inmate workers and when they get released they are
getting great jobs. There are many information service and system areas where
we can help or where we could provide assistance.  He is busy and I don't
believe that he has a perspective on what we may be able to help him
accomplish. Your help with a good word would be appreciated. I hope it is
settling down for you and that there are more good days than bad.

Dear Governor, 

Despite any reservations regarding Robbie's education, I can guarantee you personally that he will be a great credit to the Board. He is a hard worker, a person who gets things done and someone who is a central figure in our community. He is also a very good and decent man.

As you know, a person does not need to have an advanced education to do great things. I won't bore you with the long list of success stories who didn't even have high school degrees.

Robbie will be a credit to the Board, to UWF and to you. I ask that you ask your administration to place him on the board. This is especially important since the closest state board member is six hours away in Ocala. 

Thank you,

These are the two radio spots that were drafted March 2001 for you to record about the WWII Memorial project. Joe Martory, Chairman of the Florida Commission for Veterans' Affairs drafted the Hispanic piece. These were sent in March to Leslie Steele in your press office.  
 
It's too late for you to do the radio spot, so I'll ask commissioners tomorrow if they want someone else to cut the spots.  There are a few radio stations throughout Florida that will play the spots for free.  The more we can heighten awareness for the project, the more money and support we may get.
 
Don't forget December 7th is in motion for a ceremony at the Museum of Florida History (9 or 10 am), followed by a reception in the Capitol's court yard.  I'm coordinating the schedule of events for that day.  If you need anything in particular, please let me know.

Gov. Bush, 
Thanks for considering me for the FAMU Board of Trustees.  Overall, I'm 
pleased with the board you have put in place.  I believe the FAMU community 
is okay with them as well, some are somewhat in a state of uncertainty, but I 
think things will work out just fine.  I'm sorry I didn't make it.   
Nevertheless, I did express to the staff member who contacted me that I had 
some interest in other university boards (FIU, UCF & USF).   On another note, 
while I was being considered for the FAMU board I didn't realize you were 
also seeking qualified minority applicants for the Judicial Nominating 
Committees.  I have interest in all three; Supreme Court, First DCA, and 
Second Circuit.

Subject:	Leon County Commission Selectee

June 21, 2001

Governor:	
On the matter of your selecting a commissioner for the
Leon County Commission, I hesitated sending this note
to you or asking others to do so on my behalf because
I am sure you are aware of me and my credentials in
public service.  It has now occurred to me that you
may perceive this as disinterest, lack of enthusiasm
for the job or a change of heart.  So, for the record,
I would be honored to be the selectee, but more
importantly, I believe my selection would be in the
best interests of the county (government and people)
you, and most importantly, the future of Leon County.
The composition of the present board has wrecked havoc
on county staff, left unsolved problems and strayed
from responsible governing.  Many of the hard fought
battles for conservative outcomes are now at the risk
of coming undone.  The current critical issues facing
Leon County are: executing the spending priorities for
Blueprint 2000 (the penny sales tax initiative for
roads, storm-water and land use); resolving the
property rights issues in Bradfordville; finalizing
the siting of the Transfer Station; developing a
funding scheme for indigent health care; and insuring
that the reapportionment process enhances reelection
possibilities for Republicans in Leon County.  All are
issues that I have worked on and know very well.
Without a strong advocate, well versed in the
arguments, the present deadlock can easily swing to
placate the more liberal element.  
I believe many of the candidates could fill some valid
selection criteria better than I but none is more
qualified.  No one is more philosophically in lock
step with you, being on record as espousing and
working toward smaller government, diverse economic
development, strong property rights and courageous
decision making for the greater good!  I have
withstood much public scrutiny for ideals and have no
problem doing it again to see these goals to fruition.
Your decision in filling this position, I am confident
will be a good one, and as a good soldier, I bow to
your judgment as to the best profile for the
appointee.  I only want to assure you that I would
work diligently to make you and the constituents
comfortable with my selection and Leon County a better
place to live as a result of my efforts.
Thank you for being so accessible. I would welcome the
chance to respond to any questions or concerns you may
have.

Subject:	Florida Internet High School Credits & Other Matters

Why is it that Florida High School Internet Classes are so very
limited?  Doesn't it make good sense to allow "unlimited" enrollment;
particularly in the Summer months.  Whether teaching 1 student; or, 1
million students, the set up and maintenance costs are the same.  The
only variable is grading which can , for the most part, be programed.
The present Florida Internet High School offers few; or, no credit
courses during the Summer. I feel defrauded of my tax dollars (close to
$200,000.00 paid for year 2000) when I incur such arbitrary rules that
prohibit our students from achieving and excelling according to their
abilities and speed. I feel sick when I see my hard earned money going
to socialized programs and corrupt organizations.

Let me recommend that Florida Internet High School become an unlimited
and integral part of:  lowering class size, making up credits, advancing
students early to allow seniors who work for the credits to graduate in
December; and, others to have half day senior schedules.  Students who
are sick; or, suspended for a long period of time can also be better
served. Graduating the more advanced students, early, allows for smaller
class size and more individualized teaching directed to the more
academically needy students.  Economically needy students, who finish
early, can then earn some money for college.

For a society that's as advanced as ours, we certainly have some
antiquated methods of teaching; and, wasteful ways of budgeting.  A
classroom should be anywhere that provokes and provides for learning (
any place, any time)!

Which brings me to another suggestion to lower class size and  better
address budgetary woes.  Why are students not allowed to test out of
certain courses via self study; or, home school.  Home school, at this
time, is an either/or option.  Why not allow a combination of:  home
study, self study, etc. and, let the semester final test (same as
public) be the measure.  Again, with more flexibility, we can create
motivation for our students to be more challenged and self reliant;
thus, allowing our high school teachers to spend more time with slow
learners.

It seems that the only education discussions that occur, in Tallahassee,
have nothing to do with teaching children:  to think critically, be goal
directed, self reliant, and enjoy learning.  When it comes to education,
both the R's and the D's are stale and rigid thinkers. What happen to
"educational choices"?  What happen to "performance based budgeting"?
What happen to being "accountable for the highest & best use of taxpayer
dollars"?

We can; and, should be doing  better.............................

Whether it's better education; or, innovative ways to reduce congested
highways, please urge our State Republican leaders to distinguish
themselves by catching up to our vast capabilities of accomplishing
better outcomes through more critical thinking;  use of technology; and,
trusting the taxpayers to make choices.

Governor, unless you and our other Republican leaders in Tallahassee act
in lock step; and, at bullet speed to break the hold of "socialism" ,
we're all going to be doomed.  You've made some inroads; however, they
haven't been in a manner that captivates the majority voter, the "40
hour working man".  How many people understand what you're trying to do
with "One Florida"; or "Career Service", or, "Merit Raises", or,
"Privatization", etc.?  What people do understand is:  "Ten, 20, Life"!
What they will also grasp quickly is your trust in them, via:
telecommuting, flex time, educational choices; and, other means of
saving them money while relieving congestion and stress.  The only
descending thought I've ever heard preventing tele- commuting and flex
time is performance. When the measure of performance is a criteria:  the
employee performs, is put back under the microscope; or, is simply
fired.

Last two questions:  (1)  Why is it that we don't see more of your ideas
implemented through administrative, or executive orders.  (2)  Why is it
that we don't see our three top Republican leaders working together on
more Republican issues, like the ones I've described?  After all, the
three of you were elected with a mandate based on the Republican
message:  less government, better government, more choices, and personal
responsibility!

Hope you and your family are going to be able to enjoy a good old
fashion summer vacation, this year.

As always, best regards, Deb.

p.s.  Our family celebrated our friend Diane Smith's 50th birthday at
the "Brooks & Dunn" sell out concert at the Ice Palace, Saturday night.
Found another good campaign song for you to try out:  "Red, White &
Blue"  or/an altered version.  Not a theme song or video (like "40 Hour
Week"); but, a good warm up song.

Subject: Board of Trustees Appointments


Governor,
 
I suspect you've been receiving a torrent of e-mails from all the people who wish to be appointed to University Boards. I've purposely made an effort not to "send in the storm troopers" and have others pester you on my behalf. However, it does occur to me that you should know, from me, that I would consider it a privilege and an honor to sit on the new Board of Trustees for FSU. (I know I wasn't the first round draft choice from my family, but since Cliff isn't able to serve I'd like to!)
 
My application goes into detail about my long history with FSU. I put myself through school, living in a scholarship house and participating in all the usual college activities. Because I stayed in Tallahassee after graduation I made it a point to remain active as an alumna. I've done everything from serving as Chair of the College of Human Sciences Board twice, to serving on the last Presidential Search committee and being a member of the Medical School Advisory Study Committee. 
 
I see FSU's potential for greatness. I also see, though, the need for strong leadership, knowledgeable in the legislation just passed and committed to seeing it succeed. FSU is one player in Florida's K through 20 system, and as such must be a partner in bringing the recent changes to fruition.
 
I believe the characteristic that differentiates me from others who may have applied is my knowledge of and relationships within the business community and the legislature. I am comfortable in both arenas, and am not particularly intimidated by either. In advancing your education agenda and moving the University forward both will be important.
 
Thank you for your consideration, and please know if selected I will do my best for you and the University.
 
Best regards,
Lee Hinkle

governor.  the School Superintendent Association has done a survey that demonstrates that the majority of Florida's school districts think they must make cuts due to the current budget.  Therefore, they are asking that you target the saved revenue from vetoes to fund education next session.  I don not know how they are counting their funding, but have asked.

Since you have vetoed several projects and rightfully so in most cases, 
please think about supporting the Education Budget with that vetoed money. 
If the vetoed money flows into the general fund let's take a portion to help 
maintain our children's education.  Many districts like our in Bay County 
will be under a crunch in this upcoming budget.

Subject:	Leon County Commission vacancy

Governor Bush,

My name is William L. Moor, Jr. and I have applied for the vacancy on the
Leon County Commission.  I want to serve on the Commission because I believe
we need professional business people who are willing to serve in order to
improve the quality of government in our community.  With the support of my
employer, Capital City Bank Group and William G. Smith, Jr., its CEO, I am
able to apply for this position. Capital City is a large financial
institution in the community and the State of Florida and can afford me this
opportunity to serve my community and maintain my current duties and
responsibilities at the bank.

Although there are many applicants for this position, I believe I am
qualified for this position for many reasons.  The commission needs a
business person who understands the economics of both sound fiscal
management and the importance of responsible growth.  My educational
background is in business and is a product of the community and the State.
Locally, I graduated from Leon High School.  I received a Bachelor of
Science in Finance from the University of Florida, and a Masters in Business
Administration from Florida State University.  Currently, I serve on the MBA
Advisory Board for Florida State University.

As a sixth generation Tallahasseean, I care about this community and have
been involved in the community in various organizations.  I am a past chair
of Leadership Tallahassee, the YMCA, the American Heart Association and
LARC.  I have served in several offices with the Tallahassee Downtown
Improvement Authority where I continue on the executive committee working to
improve our downtown center to reduce urban sprawl.  Recently, I was
appointed to serve on the Fee Arbitration Committee for the Second Circuit.
I have served on many committees and boards in various organizations in the
community including the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce.

Leon County needs a commissioner with contacts in other communities around
the state.  We need to open the communication lines with the other
communities to discover new ways of financing growth and learn from the
mistakes of those communities.  In addition, Leon County is not an island,
and needs to have a statewide vision.  At the statewide level I am actively
involved in Leadership Florida, and have served in several positions with
the American Heart Association Florida/Puerto Rico Affiliate where I am
incoming Secretary to the Board.  I am also, a past member of the board for
Community Bankers of Florida, the Florida Bankers Association and served on

In closing, I will bring a fresh perspective to local politics.  The
perspective of a business person who has worked for fourteen years in
business in Tallahassee and has been active in the community and the state.
A business person who wants to serve in government to improve our community.
Also, I am willing to run again for commissioner at the end of the term of
office.  Please consider my application for the position.  I would be
honored to answer any questions you have of me.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush and the Cabinet: I am a proud 2 year veteran of the Florida Highway Patrol, and overall a 5 and 1/2 year veteran of Florida law enforcement, EMS, and former firefighter. I would like for you to consider Chief Chris Knight to be selected as the Florida Highway Patrols next Director. I feel that the citizens/visitors of this state would greatly benefit from his leadership of OUR agency. I came to this agency to be among the best and proudly work for my home state, and I feel that Chief Chris Knight also shares those sentiments. I feel he will lead our agency with integrity and honesty for a long time coming. Thank You, Trooper Kurt A. Lynn

These are the two radio spots that were drafted March 2001 for you to record about the WWII Memorial project. Joe Martory, Chairman of the Florida Commission for Veterans' Affairs drafted the Hispanic piece. These were sent in March to Leslie Steele in your press office.  
 
It's too late for you to do the radio spot, so I'll ask commissioners tomorrow if they want someone else to cut the spots.  There are a few radio stations throughout Florida that will play the spots for free.  The more we can heighten awareness for the project, the more money and support we may get.
 
Don't forget December 7th is in motion for a ceremony at the Museum of Florida History (9 or 10 am), followed by a reception in the Capitol's court yard.  I'm coordinating the schedule of events for that day.  If you need anything in particular, please let me know.

Dear Governor Bush -- Once again -- and I can't do it often enough -- please
accept my thanks and those of all rural Florida for allowing HB 1225 to
become law.  As you know, Florida's 33 rural counties  badly need additional
economic development  tools to help create the kind of jobs that will allow
those counties to enjoy the same level of prosperity as the rest of Florida.
We appreciate your recognition of the importance of economic development,
especially as it applies to rural Florida.  Jobs do enhance the "quality of
life", as I have never met someone with a good quality of life who didn't
have a job.
     Thanks also, for your leadership in approving the Rails To Trails grant
for the Lake Butler to Palatka link.  It will be another excellent item for
our tourism tool kit.
     I appreciated the opportunity to speak before you and the rest of the
Cabinet earlier this month especially since two of my cousins from Sweden
were with me and they were VERY impressed with seeing how democracy works in
America.  They would never have had a similar opportunity to observe
decision-making at that level in their home country.
     Again, thanks for being a friend to rural Florida and to Putnam County,
in particular.
    Warmest regards, Wes Larson, Chairman, Rural Issue Working Group and
President, Putnam County Chamber of Commerce.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

The Honorable Jeb Bush; I've been on the Florida Highway Patrol only five years however, I'm a retired Naval Officer of 22 years of decorated service. My extensive knowledge of managerial skills both in peace time and during conflict I believe give me a unique insight to people. Your task in selecting a new leader for this great body of decicated men and women who serve proudly the state of Florida is no easy task, to that end I wish you the best. I've found that in Chief Knight there is a genuine love of the Patrol and for the people who serve. He believes you can't change anything for the better if you are fixed in the belief that it was good enough way back when. Being a retired officer I I along with so many others believed the mark of a good leader, is as Dwight D. Eisenhower said," A good leader is one who can get others to do what you want them them to do, because they want to". Chief Knight has learned that concept. Regardless of the decision, all the slecttees are capable individuals. I wish you the best. The Patrol is not one person, it is the spirit and heart of our great State. Very Respectfully,

I am sorry I was not able to attend Tuesday meeting but I was receiving two awards.  The following is the status report on United Home care legal action to stop the implementation bill

1.  The existing Chapter 430 language talks about "at least one CCE lead agency"  The implementation bill doesn't introduce a new protocol only emphasizes what is already there
2. Up to 1999 Miami Dade county used to have 2 CCE lead agencies.  One was the county and the other one was Untied Home therefore,  the situation that exist now of only one CCE agency  for   Dade county  is the exception to the rule.  The language is restoring what was there before   From 1979 to 1999 2 CCE lead agencies in  Dade County.  From late 1999 to the present time only one

I have been told that the wording  to the implementation bill was added by Rep Lacasa, chairman of the appropriation committee

I will continue to keep you posted

RE:  Case No. 2001-03232 Complaint Against Woodrow J. Tucker
Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DB&PR)
 
Dear Mr. Gallagher:
 
In my last letter, my first letter to you, I made mention of my nephew Doug Thompson.  There is a deeper significance: it was Doug’s aunt, his mother’s sister, Ruth Elvada Denniston Blevins, whom the government tortured to death and dare not give an excuse why.  So, as has been said before, there we have the impossible: an effect without a cause.  This hits pretty close to home, the classroom.  I point this out because you not only have a right to know, I believe, indeed, you have a need to know.  As for the attorney who brought the government into this affair, and is likewise liable, that would be William R. “Bill” Webb, falsely posturing as a judge, while still my attorney, and that is a fact of truth that is absolutely irrefutable (Ref: Case No. 91-6383, Division H, unsettled).  
 
The foregoing is just a mere scratch on the surface of what is involved in the present complaint against Woody Tucker Plumbing: the government provides Bill Webb and all others who come against us can’t-be-sued/dare-not-sue safe sanctuary, and that, of course, includes Woody Tucker, electrician James Dennis, WREC, Pasco County Government itself, and others.  The question we have here is, if you should help us, are you going to be punished by other sectors of the government for having done so?  This is some more of what we have seen far too much of over these past more than 13 years after hiring William R. Webb and Carlson Meissner, et al. on December 24, 1987 to represent us, only to have them reverse represent us, and worse.  
 
There are bundles of additional information, and it is available to you for the mere asking, the point being that I do not want you or anyone else to be blindsided.  I see there is a possibility that county attorney Robert “Bobby” Sumner will be pulled into this.  I have this to say about him and other lawyers: be careful about putting too much stock in what they say: they are not inclined to tell the truth, and we dare not tell a lie.  
 
Sincerely,

Robert F. Blevins

the position.

Jeb, Maggie was someone who helped Miriam and me in the luncheon we did in 
your honor at the Radisson during your last bid for Governor.  She was 
responsible for selling ten tables and she came through.  She also assisted 
us greatly in the Presidential campaign by providing vans for election day.  
She is a good friend also of Jorge Arrizurieta, you might want to get 
references from him.

I would appreciate your consideration of Maggie's application.  She is very 
intelligent, has the required background and has been working in the field 
for many years.  

Thanks!

Honorable Gov. Bush and Cabinet, I have been a trooper for over 11 years. I feel the best candidate for the position of director for the Florida Highway Patrol is Chief Chris Knight. Chief Knight has always strived to serve the Patrol and the state in a professional manner. I believe that with Chief Knight as the director the Patrol will once again become the finest law enforcement agency in the state.

Dear Mike,
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss the Florida Nurses Association
position on this health care bill. As I mentioned we do understand the
position of the Florida Board of Nursing in opposition to moving the Board
to Tallahassee by 2003. It was my understanding that the board intends to
seek legislation in the next two sessions to void that provision within the
bill. I am stunned at their opposition to the Center for Nursing because the
Nurse Practice Act was the place determined by bill drafting as the logical
place to create the Center which will have no impact on the Board of
Nursing. As I mentioned there are several provisions in SB 1558 that are
priority issues for the Nursing Profession and in fact most Nursing
Associations or Societies support the relocation of the Board to
Tallahassee. In regard to other items you and Mita raised during our
conversation Gloria Henderson voiced the ability of the Department to do and
in most instances voiced support of the department to initiate.

It is very unusual for this association to oppose positions taken by the
Board but our support for SB 1558 is overwhelming and the Florida Nurses
Association would be very distressed if this bill is vetoed. I had sent at
least one e-mail message to the Governor asking for his support for the bill
quite recently.

Thanks for all you have helped me. Your support and advice is always
appreciated and respected!

Sincerely,

Barbara Lumpkin

The following is a recommendation of Chief Jim Lee for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Greetings Honorable Governor Bush and Cabinet. I have been a State Trooper for almost 10 tears and I have seen alot happen come and go. I have had an opportunity to meet and know these three men over my years of service and I don't know of any reason why either one of these men shouldn't be the director. They all could bring to the department a lot of knowledge and skills along with increased morale. I guess the thing that really stands out to me is the first time I met Chief Jim Lee when I was a Trooper in Orlando. I met him in passing at the patrol station shortly after he took over for Major Sunburg. After that very short meeting, Chief Jim Lee remembered me by my name and remembered my famliy. I had had intermitent contact with Chief Lee over the years and each time, he has not forgotten who I was or about my family. That is one thing that has really stood out to me over the years. Most people forget you unless they've met you a dozen times or more. Thank You for this opportunity to express my vote.

this new board as a guest. I am hopeful that they will work toward improving

My boys attend school in Pasco County and are doing great. However, it has
taken a major team effort of my family and school personnel to get the boys
where they are today. We have a friendly collaborative relationship with the
district!! :)

As the Education & Training Director of the Center for Autism & Related

"Please veto the bad 
billboard bill - HB 1053". 
 
 

Reasons to veto the bill: 
First, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad public policy: 

1. HB 1053 creates special property rights for billboards not enjoyed by 
other personal property. 
2. HB 1053 overturns years of decisions and planning by local governments 
3. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of "carve-outs" for some 
politically powerful areas. 
4. HB 1053 is essentially an unfunded mandate that will increase the cost of 
local government. 
5. HB 1053 is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the 
Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic beauty. 

Second, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is contrary to the Fundamental 
Principles of the Republican Party: 

1. The Republican Party believes in equal rights, equal justice and equal 
opportunity for all: 
a. HB 1053 creates a new extra privilege for billboards not available to 
other types of personal property. 
b. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of the "carve-outs" that 
were created for communities with powerful legislators. 
2. The Republican Party believes the most effective, responsible and 
responsive government is government closest to the people.  HB 1053 
overturns local decisions and substitutes "big government" mandates. 

Third, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad politics: 

1. HB 1053's billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida 
which include: 
a. The Florida League of Cities 
b. The Florida Association of Counties 
c. The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs 
d. 1000 Friends of Florida 
e. American Planning Association Florida Chapter 
f. Citizens for a Scenic Florida 
g. Florida League of Conservation Voters 
and 
h. Over 20 major newspapers in Florida 
2. HB 1053 serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too 
many inappropriately placed billboards. 
3. HB 1053 is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.  After all, 
the ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected 
councils and commissions. 
4. HB 1053 is inconsistent with Gov. Bush's previous support for decisions 
being made by local government.

"Please veto the bad 
billboard bill - HB 1053". 
 
 

Reasons to veto the bill: 
First, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad public policy: 

1. HB 1053 creates special property rights for billboards not enjoyed by 
other personal property. 
2. HB 1053 overturns years of decisions and planning by local governments 
3. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of "carve-outs" for some 
politically powerful areas. 
4. HB 1053 is essentially an unfunded mandate that will increase the cost of 
local government. 
5. HB 1053 is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the 
Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic beauty. 

Second, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is contrary to the Fundamental 
Principles of the Republican Party: 

1. The Republican Party believes in equal rights, equal justice and equal 
opportunity for all: 
a. HB 1053 creates a new extra privilege for billboards not available to 
other types of personal property. 
b. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of the "carve-outs" that 
were created for communities with powerful legislators. 
2. The Republican Party believes the most effective, responsible and 
responsive government is government closest to the people.  HB 1053 
overturns local decisions and substitutes "big government" mandates. 

Third, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad politics: 

1. HB 1053's billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida 
which include: 
a. The Florida League of Cities 
b. The Florida Association of Counties 
c. The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs 
d. 1000 Friends of Florida 
e. American Planning Association Florida Chapter 
f. Citizens for a Scenic Florida 
g. Florida League of Conservation Voters 
and 
h. Over 20 major newspapers in Florida 
2. HB 1053 serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too 
many inappropriately placed billboards. 
3. HB 1053 is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.  After all, 
the ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected 
councils and commissions. 
4. HB 1053 is inconsistent with Gov. Bush's previous support for decisions 
being made by local government.

Dear Mike,
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss the Florida Nurses Association
position on this health care bill. As I mentioned we do understand the
position of the Florida Board of Nursing in opposition to moving the Board
to Tallahassee by 2003. It was my understanding that the board intends to
seek legislation in the next two sessions to void that provision within the
bill. I am stunned at their opposition to the Center for Nursing because the
Nurse Practice Act was the place determined by bill drafting as the logical
place to create the Center which will have no impact on the Board of
Nursing. As I mentioned there are several provisions in SB 1558 that are
priority issues for the Nursing Profession and in fact most Nursing
Associations or Societies support the relocation of the Board to
Tallahassee. In regard to other items you and Mita raised during our
conversation Gloria Henderson voiced the ability of the Department to do and
in most instances voiced support of the department to initiate.

It is very unusual for this association to oppose positions taken by the
Board but our support for SB 1558 is overwhelming and the Florida Nurses
Association would be very distressed if this bill is vetoed. I had sent at
least one e-mail message to the Governor asking for his support for the bill
quite recently.

Thanks for all you have helped me. Your support and advice is always
appreciated and respected!

Sincerely,

Barbara Lumpkin

Dear Ms. Burn:

Please accept my apology for not responding earlier.  We have been inundated
with email and I have not caught up.

I hope the following is helpful.

Individual school districts and teachers will financially benefit from the
new Recruitment and Retention Initiatives in the following manner:
1) Each school district will be allocated a lump sum of that the district
can decide how to best use to recruit new teachers.  Lee County will be
receiving $3 million for this purpose.
2) Each school board is required to contact its regional workforce board, to
identify resources that may assist teachers who are teaching out-of-field
and who are pursuing certification.  School boards should leverage any
available workforce funds to assist current teachers in obtaining additional
certification and assist professionals seeking to qualify to enter the
teaching profession.
3)    Each school district will be provided funds to allow each classroom
teacher, guidance counselor, social worker, placement specialist, school
psychologist, librarian, media specialist, etc as defined in s.
228.041(9)(a-d), F.S. to receive an $850 retention bonus.  Roughly 3,000
instructional personnel will be receiving retention bonuses in Lee County.  
4) Additional financial incentives - a total of $31 million statewide - will
be provided to teachers who achieve National Board Certification. In
addition to the current awards that include the 90% fee subsidy, an annual
bonus of 10% of the prior year's statewide average salary for  achieving
certification and the equivalent of 12 workdays for mentoring - board
certified teachers will now also receive an additional $500 bonus for
achieving board certification status and $500 for those board certified
teachers that agree to mentor, totaling an additional $1,000 for teacher who
become board certified.
5) Districts are provided funds to continue the teacher lead program that
provides stipends to classroom teachers for the purchase of classroom
instructional materials and supplies for use in teaching students.
6) Although the districts will not receive funds, teachers will financially
benefit from that state providing liability coverage for all instructional
personnel.
7)  Districts will be provided funds to award International Baccalaureate
teachers a bonus for each student who receives a score of 4 or higher on the
IB exam. Teachers will receive $50 per student meeting this criteria and a
teacher in a "D" or "F" school will receive an additional stipend of $500 if
a student scores 4 or higher on the exam.

Lee County

Statewide, school districts received an increase of $201 per student; the
Florida Education Finance Program Total Potential Funds increased by 6.3% or
$739 million.   Lee County received an increase of $19.4 million or 6.7%
increase over the previous year (more than the state average).  Lee county
school district staff have stated that they are tentatively short
approximately $16 million dollars in revenue due to previously negotiated
teacher contract commitments, increased insurance costs, increased facility
and fuel costs.  Many Florida school districts utilize contingency clauses
in the collective bargaining agreements that require the future pay
increases to be contingent on receipt of increased appropriations.  I am not
aware of the details of the situation in Lee County, however it appears that
local commitments were made which the district is now - despite increased
funding through the FEFP - having trouble meeting. It appears the district
has decided to look at instructional staff reductions as part of the effort
to balance the budget.

Please do not hesitate to contact the Bush-Brogan administration in the

AIA Forecasts $1.6 Billion in Aerospace Growth for 2001 -- The Aerospace
Industries Association says the U.S. aerospace industry will grow by $1.6
billion in 2001 to post annual sales of $145 billion. AIA predicts that
sales to the U.S. military will increase by $2.2 billion to $48 billion,
with NASA and non-defense federal spending dipping $1.5 billion to $11.4
billion. Sales to customers other than the U.S. government will rise
slightly to $62 billion. Some 3,827 aircraft will be delivered with a
value of about $41 billion, according to AviationNow.com. 

State Budget Includes Extra Funds for Space -- In addition to over $17
million in funding originally requested by Governor Bush for space
projects in his proposed FY-2002 budget, the budget he signed into law
last week from the Florida Legislature includes an extra $1.3 million for
spaceport infrastructure; $1 million for a UCF/UF university space
partnership; $180,400 for the Titusville-based Space Walk of Fame, and an
additional $60K for the Florida Space Research Institute.

Spaceport Master Planning Produces 2050 Land Use Plan -- The Cape
Canaveral Spaceport master planning team, sponsored by NASA, the Air
Force and the Spaceport Authority, has released a preliminary 2050 Land
Use Plan drawing of the spaceport.  Visit http://www.yourspaceport.com/
to view the plan.  The Florida Space Business Roundtable plans a luncheon
event in the near future to allow master planning sponsors and
contractors to describe the planning process and recent results.
 
U.S. Chamber Supports Satellite Export Control Shift to Commerce -- The
U.S. Chamber of Commerce has put its support behind federal legislation
to transfer jurisdiction for satellite export controls to the U.S.
Department of Commerce.  Current controls are administered by the State
Department, which industry groups believe has overly restricted U.S.
satellite exports due to concerns about the transfer of strategically
important U.S. technologies.  The current restrictions have diminished
U.S. leadership in the international satellite industry and allowed
foreign competitors to gain market share.

Robot Arm Problems Delay Shuttle Launches -- NASA’s problems in
correcting the functionality of the Space Station’s robotic arm have
caused delays for the next couple of Space Shuttle missions from the Cape
Canaveral Spaceport.  According to Space.com, the problems are largely
solved and astronauts are tentatively scheduled to attach an airlock
module to the Space Station after a July 12 launch.  If the robotic arm’s
problems persist, the mission may be delayed until September.

Russians Display Fly-Back Booster at Paris Air Show -- Russia’s
Khrunichev corp. is displaying a full-sized model of the proposed Baikal
winged reusable rocket motor at the Paris Air Show.  The 27-meter-long
vehicle would be used as a first stage or strap-on stage for
vertical-launched vehicles like Russia’s proposed Angara family of
rockets.

Space Business Roundtable Plans August Board Meeting -- The Florida Space
Business Roundtable’s board of directors will meet on August 14 at the
Cocoa Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, at 5:30 p.m.  Call 321-459-2200 for
information.

Aerospace Technology Advisory Committee Meeting Planned for June 21 --
The industry-led Aerospace Technology Advisory Committee, formed to
support the development of a national technician training and
certification program for the aerospace industry, will meet at Boeing’s
facility in Titusville, Florida, on June 21.  Call 321-449-5060 for info.

Dear Jeb 

            There are two upcoming appointments to the Hillsborough County 
Aviation Authority. The applicants include Mercy DeMaio and Jack Lamb. I 
cannot recommend these two individuals highly enough. This board is 
personally very important to me and I would consider it a personal favor for 
you to select Mercy and Jack for this significant board. I have been out of

calls us as well. 
            Again, please accept my strongest recommendation that you 
appoint Mercy DeMaio and Jack Lamb to the Hillsborough County Aviation 
Authority. 

                                    Yours,

The Chamber Board was very excited that Line Item #2367-A, the Technology Audit money was funded with this session. Again, thanks, we appreciate your support of out efforts.  
 
At the time I e-mailed you regarding the county commissions seat the list of applicants had not been posted.  I had suggested three people, two have withdrawn. The final one, Will Messer, is still on the list.  Again, I believe that of the current list , as published, he would be the best.  Today, I was informed that Bill Moor, an employee of Capital City Bank has applied. I checked with Bill Smith and Bill confirmed that he has given his blessings for Bill to pursue this ( as well as time needed).  I would suggest that Bill will be excellent for the business community and will bring a knowledge of finance accountability, which is much needed.  Again, please make your decision on the person best qualified for a high management position.  It is very much needed in our county.

At the time I e-mailed you regarding the county commissions seat the list of applicants had not been posted.  I had suggested three people, two have withdrawn. The final one, Will Messer, is still on the list.  Again, I believe that of the current list , as published, he would be the best.  Today, I was informed that Bill Moor, an employee of Capital City Bank has applied. I checked with Bill Smith and Bill confirmed that he has given his blessings for Bill to pursue this ( as well as time needed).  I would suggest that Bill will be excellent for the business community and will bring a knowledge of finance accountability, which is much needed.  Again, please make your decision on the person best qualified for a high management position.  It is very much needed in our county.

Even though each of the current candidates are honorable, dedicated and capable individuals, it is my opinion that Chief Knight has ALL the tools necessary to lead the Patrol at this very critical time.

Dear Mike,
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss the Florida Nurses Association
position on this health care bill. As I mentioned we do understand the
position of the Florida Board of Nursing in opposition to moving the Board
to Tallahassee by 2003. It was my understanding that the board intends to
seek legislation in the next two sessions to void that provision within the
bill. I am stunned at their opposition to the Center for Nursing because the
Nurse Practice Act was the place determined by bill drafting as the logical
place to create the Center which will have no impact on the Board of
Nursing. As I mentioned there are several provisions in SB 1558 that are
priority issues for the Nursing Profession and in fact most Nursing
Associations or Societies support the relocation of the Board to
Tallahassee. In regard to other items you and Mita raised during our
conversation Gloria Henderson voiced the ability of the Department to do and
in most instances voiced support of the department to initiate.

It is very unusual for this association to oppose positions taken by the
Board but our support for SB 1558 is overwhelming and the Florida Nurses
Association would be very distressed if this bill is vetoed. I had sent at
least one e-mail message to the Governor asking for his support for the bill
quite recently.

Thanks for all you have helped me. Your support and advice is always
appreciated and respected!

Sincerely,

Barbara Lumpkin

Dear Governor:  I am letting you know that I did not receive an answer to my
Question:  How is the additional state money for the teacher recruitment
and retention initiative going to filter down to the individual school
districts? from Brewser Brown (see below).

New topic:  In reading your June 15 email Newsletter concerning budget
approval, I want you to know that
o  I appreciated the fact that you did not veto the funding  for the new
Juvenile Assessment Center in Fort Myers.
o  tax relief is not a high priority for me, as a resident and tax payer in
the State of Florida.  Not having a state income tax is enough for me.  I
would gladly give back my tax relief benefit if it was used for:
  (1) mental health services for children, adolescents, and adults in
Southwest Florida, particularly the Fort Myers area,
(2) increasing wages for the working citizens, and
(3) local school system here to provide adequate staff to deal with the
influx of immigrants and the need for ESOL help.

Finally, the citizens of Southwest Florida would have appreciated having a
representative from this area on the Board of Education--3 from Miami
(including Boca Raton).   Surely one of the 120 qualified applicants must
have been from a city closer to Southwest Florida than Ocala.

I appreciate your attention.

It is my sincere wish that you would come yourself to see the Plight that low lake levels, no access to the lake for the fisherman so no tourism, has done to our dwindling economy. I understand you are coming to Stuart on the 26th of June. Could you make a detour and come to Glades County on your way there? Please!

This is a long overdue "Thank you", for your consideration and support for the request of increased funding of the services of the department of Developmental Disability.

As a parent of an adult child who is a client of this department, I appreciate your concern and involvement, which will assist in providing better services, which will hopefully enable all of the clients to have a brighter, more hopeful and complete life.

Jeb, 

      I hope all is well in Tallahassee. I know this is a very important and 
busy time during the veto process , so I will get right to the point. I have 
recieved several e-mails and calls regarding the closing of a very needy 
service.The South Florida Food Recovery program is a very important service 
for the poor and needy in North Dade and for the whole of Florida. 
Unfortunately this program can not survive without the $150,000 it was 
expecteing from the state budget. I hope collectively we can find a way to 
continue funding this crucial service, this would be important to me and a 
community I care deeply for, not to mention all the poor and underprivliged 
who rely on the food recovery program. Please let me know if there is 
anything I can do to help with this process and thank you for your 
consideration. 

Sincerely,

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Chief Knight was an excellent supervisor, probably the best I ever had. There is no doubt Chief Chris Knight would make a great Colonel for the Florida Highway Patrol. Chief Knight is what the Patrol needs to lead it into the future.

Dear Mike,
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss the Florida Nurses Association
position on this health care bill. As I mentioned we do understand the
position of the Florida Board of Nursing in opposition to moving the Board
to Tallahassee by 2003. It was my understanding that the board intends to
seek legislation in the next two sessions to void that provision within the
bill. I am stunned at their opposition to the Center for Nursing because the
Nurse Practice Act was the place determined by bill drafting as the logical
place to create the Center which will have no impact on the Board of
Nursing. As I mentioned there are several provisions in SB 1558 that are
priority issues for the Nursing Profession and in fact most Nursing
Associations or Societies support the relocation of the Board to
Tallahassee. In regard to other items you and Mita raised during our
conversation Gloria Henderson voiced the ability of the Department to do and
in most instances voiced support of the department to initiate.

It is very unusual for this association to oppose positions taken by the
Board but our support for SB 1558 is overwhelming and the Florida Nurses
Association would be very distressed if this bill is vetoed. I had sent at
least one e-mail message to the Governor asking for his support for the bill
quite recently.

Thanks for all you have helped me. Your support and advice is always
appreciated and respected!

Sincerely,

Barbara Lumpkin

This is a long overdue "Thank you", for your consideration and support for the request of increased funding of the services of the department of Developmental Disability.  I am very grateful that the Florida legislature approved, and allowed, an even greater amount than that which was initially requested.
As a parent of an adult child who is a client of this department, I appreciate your concern and involvement, which will assist in providing better services, which will hopefully enable all of the clients to have a brighter, more hopeful and complete life.
Thank you,

Subject:	State Prop Deeds, Reservations & FPL  pls help!

Dear Governor Bush, 

A while back I wrote to you and you were kind enough to have your legal 
department call me. Thank you, but our fight is not over... I will try and be 
brief and hope that you will read this... 

I originally contacted you because FPL was placing high power transmission 
lines (230,000 Volts) within 60-200 feet from our homes.  Your counsel, Greg 
Munson, contacted me, made some inquiries to DEP, and responded that 
unfortunately your office could not get involved.  I THINK WE FOUND SOMETHING 
THAT MIGHT BE YOUR JURISDICTION... PLEASE HELP...(and please read on...) 

Background 
We (homeowners) have been in discussions with FPL and South Florida Water M 
gmt District for several months.  SFWMD owns the Right of Way, and gave FPL 
permission to put the poles there.  We currently have a case in front of an 
Administrative Law Judge at the Department of Administrative Hearings, as 
well as are involved with the PSC and some of their legal team. 

NEW INFO ! / YOUR JURISDICTION ? 
Recently we uncovered that one of the sections of land that is involved in 
the FPL project was deeded to the State of Florida/everglades restoration 
WITH A RESERVATION ON IT.  To the best of our understanding, FPL is not 
permitted to put their 100 ft tall above ground transmission poles on this 
property.  Just today we brought this to the attention of the SFWMD, and 
although they acknowledged that it looks as though we were interpreting this 
info correctly, they indicated that it was not their place to enforce the 
reservation, (therefore rescinding the permit and ousting FPL off of the land 
that they never should have been on in the first place).  Please tell me that 
reservations attached to property deeds (owned by the state) would be your 
jurisdiction ... if not yours, then who would enforce them?   

I placed a call to Mr. Munson this afternoon and reached the legal department 
voicemail... I would like the opportunity to fax the deeds in question to 
your office so that you may determine if they are within your jurisdiction. 

I appreciate your taking the time to read this, as well as any help that you 
can offer.  I can't stress enough that time is of the essence. 

Many Thanks,

regard to the Transmission Line Siting Act-call me.  I would love the 
opportunity to speak with your office on the subject and let you in on all of 
the scary loopholes that we have encountered.

Governor,

You may recall that at the Arab American dinner in Orlando, some members of
the community expressed to us their desire to be more involved and several
wanted more info on the Board of Trustees positions.  The community has
gotten together and submitted the following 2 names for your consideration:
Dr. Geraldine Ferris (for UCF or UofF) and Dr. Riyad Mansour (for UCF).
Here's a little bit of info on each:

Riyad Mansour is currently the Vice President of Intram Investments, a
multi-million dollar development company based in Orlando. He is responsible
for numerous projects in the retail, restaurant, and real estate industries.
Their investments include part ownership of the Central Florida Bennigans,
TGI Fridays, and Wendy's.  He's been elected for three consecutive (2) year
terms to the board of the International Drive Chamber of Commerce, which
deals with major issues related to the tourist industry in Central Florida.
He is a leader in the Arab-American community, having been elected for two
consecutive (2) year terms as President of the Arab American Community
Center in Orlando and continues to serve as an ex-officio member of its
Board.  Dr. Riyad has a strong academic background; he holds a PhD in
Sociology. 

I think that you know Dr. Ferris so I won't include a lot of her info.  In
the last election, she was the Republican that ran against Rep. Andy
Gardiner in the primary.  She's a dentist, has a health education
background, and is a well established member of the community.

I can recommend both to you.  Let me know if you need additional
information. Good luck in your decision-making.  Talk to you soon. Lila

If the vetoed money flows into the general fund let's take a portion to help

deals with major issues related to the tourist industry in Central Florida.
He is a leader in the Arab-American community, having been elected for two
consecutive (2) year terms as President of the Arab American Community
Center in Orlando and continues to serve as an ex-officio member of its
Board.  Dr. Riyad has a strong academic background; he holds a PhD in
Sociology. 

I think that you know Dr. Ferris so I won't include a lot of her info.  In
the last election, she was the Republican that ran against Rep. Andy
Gardiner in the primary.  She's a dentist, has a health education
background, and is a well established member of the community.

I can recommend both to you.  Let me know if you need additional
information. Good luck in your decision-making.  Talk to you soon. Lila

Subject:	Wilderness preservation in central Florida

Dear Gov. Bush:    As a native Floridian seriously concerned about the
geometric increase in population growth's effect on our wild lands, I HOPE
you will specifically address this pressing issue in your re-election
campaign---and not forget that while the Everglades is essential, it isn't
the only environmentally threatened region:  Central Florida is willy-nilly
being turned into stucco and asphalt, giving wildlife no place to flee.
Developers here, for the most part, are unconscionable---mowing down
everything (because, I suppose, it's cheaper and easier) alive on huge
tracts of land, and leaving nothing but the soul-less, precictable, hideous
zero lot-line subdivisions, which they love to call charming names like "The
Preserve" or "Heron's Roost", when no bird alive in its right mind would go
within ten miles . Quality of life for ALL here in imperilled, and this is
not the shrill ranting of an extremist. I'm a diehard Republican who voted
for you and for your brother, and who has long admired your highly
UNDERrated father; I know you all are kind and thinking human beings who
think in an individual (not partyline lemming) way:  Therefore, I risk being
brushed under the rug as another Greenpeace nut (which I am FAR from), to
beg you to consider wild Florida---central Florida in particular---in your
future agenda. I was glad you were as appalled as I by the legislature's
stealing from the environmental fund to appease other sectors---this, I
think, was a gross overstepping of their bounds and would seem
unconstitutional.  We need green buffers, sizable ones, pristine lands
preserved, perhaps bought in joint deals with such entities as The Nature
Conservancy, maybe tax incentives for people to keep their land for a while
and manage it themselves, etc.  Only if the issue is seen as
important---urgent,for time IS running out---will solutions be found to
protect wild Florida while we still can. There IS a correlation between
unchecked immigration and environmental destruction, and I KNOW you are
savvy enough to see it.  Well thank you for any bit of my diatribe you take
to heart---you are a persuasive person. Many animals, people, trees and
birds wait with baited breath for your help.  God give you wisdom---and I
hope sincerely you are re-elected.
Best Regards,    Rebecca Eagan  (PS My sister is Pres. of Women Lawyers,
whom you hosted a while back at home---I hope you don't mind that she gave
me your personal email:  I promise not to abuse it!)

Subject:	SB 1558

Dear Mike,
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss the Florida Nurses Association
position on this health care bill. As I mentioned we do understand the
position of the Florida Board of Nursing in opposition to moving the Board
to Tallahassee by 2003. It was my understanding that the board intends to
seek legislation in the next two sessions to void that provision within the
bill. I am stunned at their opposition to the Center for Nursing because the
Nurse Practice Act was the place determined by bill drafting as the logical
place to create the Center which will have no impact on the Board of
Nursing. As I mentioned there are several provisions in SB 1558 that are
priority issues for the Nursing Profession and in fact most Nursing
Associations or Societies support the relocation of the Board to
Tallahassee. In regard to other items you and Mita raised during our
conversation Gloria Henderson voiced the ability of the Department to do and
in most instances voiced support of the department to initiate.

It is very unusual for this association to oppose positions taken by the
Board but our support for SB 1558 is overwhelming and the Florida Nurses
Association would be very distressed if this bill is vetoed. I had sent at
least one e-mail message to the Governor asking for his support for the bill
quite recently.

Thanks for all you have helped me. Your support and advice is always
appreciated and respected!

Sincerely,

Barbara Lumpkin

Dear Governor Bush:
 
   We are immensely proud of our governor for his courageous action in vetoing the subject bill.  I can imagine that it is not a popular position to take when the Republican dominated legislature produces a bill for the signature of the Republican governor and he vetoes it.  I am also sure that it is difficult to confront your legislative colleagues with a position that totally opposes their collegial thinking, but once again, you have stood firm and acted in good faith representation of the people's interest.  You will probably not be rewarded in Tallahassee for this decision, but across Florida, it will hopefully be acclaimed as another example of why Jeb Bush is a Governor who carefully weighs the public interest to be sure that it is served and not harmed by an action requested by private commercial interests.  Senator King, Senator Holzendorf and Representative Davis all failed to keep their word when they voted for this bill, but our Governor did not disappoint us by signing this terrible bill.  We will not forget your action or theirs.
 
Many thanks for your statesmanship.

Dear Governor Bush: 

      It has come to the attention of the Economic Council of Palm Beach 
County, Inc., that Mr. David McIntosh has applied for appointment to the 
University of Florida Board of Trustees.  The Economic Council strongly 
supports his appointment. 
      Mr. McIntosh is a well-known and highly-respected businessman in Palm 
Beach County and in Florida.  A certified public accountant by training, Mr. 
McIntosh currently is chairman of MitBank USA, Inc., a private wetlands 
mitigation bank.  From 1998 to 2000, he was chief executive officer of 
Barricade International, Inc., a private manufacturer and distributor of a 
fire-blocking gel and other related products.  Prior to that, he was CEO of 
the Florida law firm of Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart, P.A., and spearheaded the 
firm's growth from three offices and 50 attorneys to seven offices and more 
than 175 attorneys. 
      An alumnus of the University of Florida, Mr. McIntosh continues to be 
active in the activities of the school.  He is a past president and charter 
member of the National Alumni Association, a 20-year board member of the 
University of Florida Foundation, a past vice president of the university's 
Athletic Association, a 12-year member of the Business College Advisory Board 
and a member of the 1983/84 and 1999/2000 Presidential Search Committees, to 
name only a few of his affiliations with the university.  I could list many 
more. 
      Mr. McIntosh is not only a distinguished alumnus of the University of 
Florida, he is committed to its continuing educational excellence.  He is an 
excellent candidate for trustee and would be an outstanding appointment to 
the University of Florida Board of Trustees.  The Economic Council feels his 
participation as a trustee would be of great benefit to the university. 
      Thank you for your consideration of our recommendation.  If you have

Greetings, I am not a Trooper, but I am a Duty Officer Supervisor (Communications Supervisor). I have been with the Patrol for 15 years, so I'd like for my vote to count. I believe that CHIEF KNIGHT is the best selection for the job of Director. He has always been perceived as fair and unbiased, both by the Officer on the road and by myself. Chief Knight has over 10 years of service ahead of him, and as his past record will confirm, as Director of the Florida Highway Patrol Chief Knight would use those years to bring about positive changes aimed at improving the conditions of the Florida Highway Patrol to better serve the citizens of our fine state. Thank-you for allowing me to submit my vote. Duty Officer Supervisor Elaine D. Kelly Lake City Troop B

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

My name is Wallace Marcantoni, and I am a Florida State Trooper assign to Seminole County in central florida. First of all let me thank you Honorable Governor Bush and members of the Florida Cabinet for a tremendous job and the many accomplishments of this administration. We the members of the Florida Highway Patrol have a lot to be grateful. In a few days you will have the task to choose our next director. There is no doubt in my mind that the list of candidates is long and all are very well qualified. Our next director will have to make many descisions that will have an impact on all the citizens of Florida and visitors. The one thing I could ask of the Honorable Cabinet and our Governor is that please select a candidate that will have many years ahead of him in our Department. Select that candidate that will be with us for many years. Latelly we have not have a director occupaying that prestigious seat for more than three or four years. Please let us have the opportunity to serve a Director that will bring new blood to The Florida Highway Patrol. Thank you

Governor,

I was pleased to see some familiar and some not so familiar faces among the
trustees you named at FAMU this past Friday.  Now that the FAMU board has
been appointed, your focus will obviously turn to the other boards.  As I
was uncertain whether your staff had brought my application for one of these
positions to your attention, I thought it prudent to contact you regarding
my continuing interest in the FSU board.  Inasmuch as my interest was in
serving my alma mater, I applied for one board and the one board only, FSU.

Not since the day I and two other black students integrated the public
schools of Leon County, have I sensed such a defining moment in my life
relative to public education.  While in the global context this appointment
may seem inconsequential to most, it is of tremendous importance to me
personally.  As a product of FSU and the FSU College of Law, I have a strong
commitment and desire to serve an institution which has given me so much and
made me largely who I am today.  I would, likewise, appreciate the
opportunity to further serve this administration.

While I have "enlisted" everyone I could to put in a good word with the
administration for me in connection with the FSU board, there is nothing
like good ole fashioned direct contact in your own behalf. (smile)

Thanks for any favorable consideration given my application.

Cordially,

Harold

By the end of the next fiscal year, 88% of eligible kids will have insurance. This puts us in the forefront of the policy area. Why not lead?

IN terms of prevention and social services, the increases have been very significant in the last three years.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I believe that Chief Chris Knight will be the best person to bring the Florida Highway Patrol forward into the 21st Century. Although we are proceeding with projects involving new technology, the old management style is still with us. Micromanagement and intimidation should not be the order of the day as they have both lost their place in the science of personnel management. Thank you for your consideration in this most important matter.

Several bring strong qualities to the table. However, Bruce Host seems to
standout in my mind for the following reasons:
1. Recent seat provides immediate understanding of current issues
2. Stable senior official who has supported economic development when the
rest of the community did not know what it meant
3. I believe Bruce resigned when he thought he was going to run for higher
office. He has now reconsidered and if he were to be reappointed I believe
he would run again thus, maintaining the seat. If not then may want to

Jeb, as past Chair of the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, Economic
Development Council and Tally/Leon Co. Planning Commission, your pending
decision on our County's next Commissioner is of utmost importance to me.
This County desperately needs leadership, not unlike what you have provided
at the State level, to move forward. The list of applicants recently
reported in the Tally Democrat consists of many fine and qualified people.
However, considering the current fiscal state of our County and commission
mix, I feel it is critical that your appointee maintain a business
background and approach to issues facing our community. I'm not here to
advocate any one particular candidate over another but only that you factor
into your consideration process what each individual has contributed to the
economic growth of this area and region at large. Now more than ever, this
type of leadership is necessary in a city so heavily dependant on
government payroll.  I thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts
and look forward to your decision.

Subject: Manatee protection measures Brevard County


Governor,
 
I am writing to state my opposition in the strongest terms to the proposed boating speed changes along the Indian River, Brevard County. 
I pay approximately $20,000.00 in County taxes to live on this shoreline. I own a 23 ft boat and a PWC. 
I take my three children wakeboarding, skiing and tubing every weekend. It is for these pleasures that we live and enjoy  Brevard so much and why I purchased expensive waterfront property.
How can a government agency pass a law to enforce a slow speed zone along the entire shoreline Indian River in this County?
Are my taxes going to be dramatically reduced? I somehow doubt that.
I have been a long time Republican and quite frankly am very disturbed by the lack of due process.
I respectfully request that you veto this rule which serves to supposedly protect a non-endangered manatee species not indigenous to Brevard or the State of Florida.
Don't people have rights as well? I find this rule change totalitarian and at the very least undemocratic.
Finally, to force my young family into the channel in the middle of the Indian River is dangerous and not an acceptable solution.
Respectfully,
JG

Dear Carolina:
 
Thank you for your e-mail go Governor Bush on Best Buddies.  The Governor asked me to respond. 
 
Expanding services to the developmentally disabled has been one of Governor Bush's highest priorities.  As a result of the Governor's and legislature's efforts, more than 36,000 developmentally disabled Florida residents now have access to the full range of needed services.  When Governor Bush was first elected, the number of developmentally disabled Floridians being fully served was less than 10,000.  Our new state budget includes an additional $78 million for this program, sufficient funding to serve another 6,700 developmentally disabled persons who are expected to request services by July 1, 2002.  These new funds, when added to the base, are sufficient to fully serve 42,000 developmentally disabled persons by July 2002, more than a four-fold increase in three years.  During the last 3 years, state funding for developmental services has increased by 74 percent for a total of $886 million.  Our developmentally disabled citizens are now more appropriately and efficiently served in their homes and communities based upon decisions made by themselves and their families.
 
The Best Buddies program is an important part of our Developmental Services Program in Florida.  The Department of Children and Families provides $542,000 annually to the program.  Given the state's significant commitment to developmental services funding, the Governor determined any additional funds for the program should be targeted elsewhere.
 
Again, thank you for letting Governor Bush know of your interest in Best Buddies in Florida.

Dear Governor: 
You might be surprised that I am writing to you twice in one day.  I might be 
getting into a delicate area but I am going to venture on this path because I 
feel strongly about some things and above all I do not want to hear any 
criticisms about your  leadership. 
I was called by a friend that serves with me on a Board of Directors here in 
Miami. She asked me to write to you to see if you could rethink your decision 
to cut the budget on a social program. Best Buddies. As you know there are 
more than 7.5 million people with mental retardation in the United States, 
many in our State. We are very lucky because we have no one in our families 
with this problem. This program is really providing a very needed service. 
They are very successful educating high schools, college students, corporate, 
community citizens and employers about the needs and abilities of people with 
mental retardation. There have been many mentally retarded individuals that 
have been able to be integrated to their communities, thanks to this program. 
Would you be able to do something about this? I hope you can. I think that 
what they are asking from our State is around $115,000. 
I know you probably get many requests like this but I hope that you can make 
a difference by helping those who really need your attention. 
Sincerely, 

Carolina

Jeb, as past Chair of the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, Economic
Development Council and Tally/Leon Co. Planning Commission, your pending
decision on our County's next Commissioner is of utmost importance to me.
This County desperately needs leadership, not unlike what you have provided
at the State level, to move forward. The list of applicants recently
reported in the Tally Democrat consists of many fine and qualified people.
However, considering the current fiscal state of our County and commission
mix, I feel it is critical that your appointee maintain a business
background and approach to issues facing our community. I'm not here to
advocate any one particular candidate over another but only that you factor

type of leadership is necessary in a city so heavily dependant on
government payroll.  I thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts

Subject:	RE: Trade Corridor Study

Jeff, thank you for the email.  
 
As you are aware, the Trade Corridor Study proposed monies from the TOPS program for funding.  However, this item did not go through (or was successful in) the established TOPS Council process.  The Governor was very consistent in his support for items prioritized by the TOPS Council selection process--and equally so in his lack of support for items which did not go through the process.   Essentially, the funding source sought for the Study was not the appropriate one; therefore, the Governor was left with little alternative other than to veto.   [Please recall, the Governor expressed during our meeting his disappointment that TOPS monies were being identified to fund the study.]
 
However, the veto of the Trade Corridor Study (Phase II) should not be seen as a reflection of the Governor's support for the Trade and Transport Council.   As he made clear during our meeting, intermodal issues are a sincere concern of his and he was pleased to see industry involvement with the state in this regard.  
 
Hope this helps.
 
Pam

I know you are busy, but was wondering whether you could give me some 
feedback on the Governor's veto of the $400,000 Trade Corridor Study Phase II 
that I could share with the members of the Trade and Transport Council. They 
are still very committed to the intermodal infrastructure and international 
trade needs of the state and want to work in cooperation with OTTED and FDOT. 
Any insights you could provide would be great. 
Thanks.

Dear Ms. Dana,
I wanted to thank you and Governor Bush once again for the support you have
provided the Hispanic Business Initiative Fund during the recent budget
cycle. As I mentioned earlier, we are willing to host an official symbolic
event with the Governor launching our initiative statewide. The event may be
held at either of our current regional service areas (Orlando or Tampa) or
in Tallahassee.  I have discussed this possibility with key members of our
Hispanic business community and they would be willing to travel to
Tallahassee if that locale was deemed as the most appropriate.  Please do
not hesitate to contact me if you need any additional information.  I look
forward to continuing to work with you and other members of the Governor's
administration in promoting the long term development our Florida small
business community.

Governor,

I was pleased to see some familiar and some not so familiar faces among the
trustees you named at FAMU this past Friday.  Now that the FAMU board has
been appointed, your focus will obviously turn to the other boards.  As I
was uncertain whether your staff had brought my application for one of these
positions to your attention, I thought it prudent to contact you regarding
my continuing interest in the FSU board.  Inasmuch as my interest was in
serving my alma mater, I applied for one board and the one board only, FSU.

Not since the day I and two other black students integrated the public
schools of Leon County, have I sensed such a defining moment in my life
relative to public education.  While in the global context this appointment
may seem inconsequential to most, it is of tremendous importance to me
personally.  As a product of FSU and the FSU College of Law, I have a strong
commitment and desire to serve an institution which has given me so much and
made me largely who I am today.  I would, likewise, appreciate the
opportunity to further serve this administration.

While I have "enlisted" everyone I could to put in a good word with the
administration for me in connection with the FSU board, there is nothing
like good ole fashioned direct contact in your own behalf. (smile)

Thanks for any favorable consideration given my application.

Cordially,

Harold

Thanks for all you did with respect to our funding increase.   We are 
painfully over-leveraged and really will sleep better with the new 
state funding.

I will be in Silicon Valley during the Space Summit (but would have 
attended Space Summit were there any reasonable way for me to get out 
of this commitment).  However, IHMC recently hired Jack Hansen who 
until recently (he resigned from NASA effective in January) was 
Deputy Director of Ames Research Center.    Jack was one of the 
people at NASA most responsible for its research agenda.  I plan to 
send Jack to the Space Summit in my place.   I hope that we can find 
a way to make Jack feel comfortable in Florida generally and make him 
an important part of Florida's space community.  Jack remains very 
connected inside NASA and could be of substantial help to our space 
goals in Florida.

Best Wishes,
Ken

The Honorable Jeb Bush:

For twenty years I have been in correspondence with Linroy Bottoson who is

{Matthew25: 36, 43, 45}  During twenty years he has consistently portrayed a
Christian spiritual depth of insight and concern.

Mr. Bottoson has not requested that I contact you.  However, as a concerned
citizen abd friend I ask that you look closely at his case.  He has been
imprisoned for 21 years, perhaps unjustly.  I ask that you review the case
of Linroy Bottoson before issuing a warrant for death.

Thank you very much for your attention.

A hastily called strategy meeting of elected leaders, union officials, and citizens by Rep. Gustavo Barreiro, R-Miami, took place Friday at the Marriott Hotel located just outside the airport.  Barreiro was responding to a call for help from leaders of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union that represents 23,000 American Airlines (AA) flight attendants worldwide.  Also attending were Rep. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, Rep. Edward Bullard, D-Miami, Miami-Dade Commissioner Joe Martinez, Miami Beach Commissioner David Dermer, and Henry Givens the past chair of the County Community Relations Board.
 
The National Mediation Board has been working with AA management and union representatives in an effort to avoid a Jul.1, 2001 strike by flight attendants that would shut down the airline.  Political and business leaders are concerned that the loss of over 4,000 jobs would have a severe impact on the local economy of Miami-Dade.  AA is the largest carrier operating out of Miami International Airport and is in the process of building a new terminal.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I select Chris Knight for several very important reasons. He is young and can offer the Patrol the time that is needed to lift the FHP from the low status it has been subjected to over the last 15 years, with the exception of the time period Colonel Grimming was in office. Chief Knight is enthusiastic, progressive, open minded, a natural LEADER and most of all he is well respected and trusted by the Troopers as a whole. What we need now is trusted leadership to lift the morale of the troopers, and someone who cares about the organization and it's future. Presently the Patrol has no future, it has been leaderless for too long. Chris Knight is the only logical non-political choice. I feel that without his appointment, the Patrol will continue to plummet downhill and completely loose the respect of the citizens it was created to serve.

WATER RIGHTS (State Suit against another State for Money Damages with
Prejudgment Interest Constitutional)

The United States Supreme Court held (opinion by Stevens; unanimous as to
Parts I, IV, and V; 6-3 as to Parts II and III; concurrence in part and
dissent in part by O'Connor) that a State may recover monetary damages
from another State in an original action without violating the Eleventh
Amendment.

Since 1901, Kansas has contested the diversion of water from the Arkansas
River by surrounding states.  Later, Kansas and Colorado agreed to the
Arkansas River Compact (Compact), approved by Congress in 1949, to settle
existing disputes over the river.  After the Court ruled in 1995 that
Colorado violated the Compact it remanded the case to the Special
Master.  The Special Master recommended that Kansas be awarded monetary
damages, accruing since 1969 and including prejudgment interest, for
Colorado's violations of the Compact.  Colorado filed four objections to
the Special Master's report, all of which the Court overruled.  The
Supreme Court upheld the recommendations of the Special Master, and
remanded the case to the Special Master to prepare a final judgment
consistent with the opinion.  It concluded that the suit by Kansas against
Colorado does not violate the Eleventh Amendment; that the common law
distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages is not a sound
one, justifying prejudgment interest on the latter; that the rate of
prejudgment interest on the award was not excessive but interest should
begin to run starting in 1985, when Kansas first filed suit; and that the
Special Master correctly calculated crop damage based on expert testimony
provided by Kansas.  [Summarized by Peter J. Dassow]

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My call to you on Wednesday was to discuss what happened this week at the
SFWMD. 
 
Let me begin by stating your appointing me to the Governing Board was and is
truly a great honor.  I wish nothing more than to support you and the mission
you have for the SFWMD.  This is such a critical time for the District.
 
In the last month, three of the largest newspapers in the state (Miami
Herald, Palm Beach Post, and Sun Sentinel) have decried the Governing Board
turmoil.  It had to come to an end.  Seeing is believing, from here on out,
you will see stability on the Board and at the agency; this is my pledge to
you.
  
While I may not have been your first choice, please know that I too am
committed to you and your administration.
 
The majority of the Governing Board believed it was time to not only change
leadership at the agency, but on the Governing Board.
 
My message to you is simple, we are all committed to you and to making Henry
Dean, the District, and the Everglades Restoration a great success.  And we
will!!
 
I have a great relationship with David Struhs, Denver Stutler, and Henry

The veto of the line item for the Pompano Sate Farmers Market is to 
commended. Last year over $ 2 million for this useless facility scaped your 
veto. This market has not served any Florida producers for the last 12 years 
or so, Over the last 30 years it has helped a group of 4 or 5 local brokers 
who have enriched themselves on the backs of many small farmers that 
eventualy went broke. Today it only serves brokers and distributors who 
should be relying on their own money and not a state subsidized facility.

Today I sat through a double header in Sarasota with Laurie Lombardo, the woman whose  minor daughter  was allowed by the court to move out of her house.  She told me that she spent 11/2 hours on the phone with a couple of attorneys from your office.  Apparently they were as incredulous as I was upon hearing the story.  She kept a daily journal of the entire 2 year ordeal and documented everything.  That should be helpful with an investigation.  She will keep me apprised of developments.  
 
Thanks for looking into it.  I hope something good will come out of their misfortune, and maybe some of the creeps getting rich off the misery of others will get their just reward.

Yesterday I drove to Bradenton for a double header after driving Friday and Saturday to Winter Haven for Harrison's tournament.  Ben's coach's brother is the assistant coach and I chatted yesterday with his wife for several hours.  They live in Apopka I think.  Anyway.....................
 
She proceeded to tell me about 2.5 years of absolute hell that they went through with their oldest daughter.  She was an honor roll student who at the age of 15 got mixed up with  a drug ring in Orlando.  At sixteen she decided to move out of her parents house so she told the court she was pregnant.  The judge allowed her to move out of her parents home and in with drug dealers on her word.  Her parents could not legally intervene.  They could not get her pregnancy tested neither could they have her drug tested.  The DCF was on their side and they hired an attorney, but the judge ruled that they had no parental rights.
 
After the kid moved in with the dealers they hid her on the Orange Blossom Trail for 7 months and her parents could not find her, thanks to the ruling of the court..  They finally got a sheriff over there to make her a priority  and found her.  She was court ordered into treatment because she was crack addict and she brought down a whole ring of dealers and thieves in Orlando, some of whom were important people over there.
 
How can our state laws be that screwed up?  I told she should sit down with their state legislators, but she said no one is interested.  She's written letters to everyone over there, even to your office and gotten nowhere.  I was shocked.  They spent thousands of dollars on attorneys, investigators to try to find their daughter and correct what the court had done.   I can't really relate the whole story but it's unbelievable.

Dear Governor:

When the legislature is contemplating new laws for the State of Florida, where do members get most of their input from?  Is it from other legislators or from the public?  It seems that Florida's legislature passes numerous laws without input from the state's citizens.  I came to this conclusion after my wife and I viewed the statutes on several occassions to find new laws that took effect that we had not even heard about.  It appears that many of the laws are built upon existing laws; yet, those individuals and families that are most affected by these laws have no input.
I know I am being vague as I'm not citing any one example -- I endeavor to be discreet when writing from my work (Florida Philharmonic Orchestra) e-mail address, but it is the underlying principle of citizens being informed before major decisions are made.  What does it take for one to have the opportunity to formally address the legislature in person?  And, while you are basically inaccessible to the general public (for security and other reasons, I'm sure), what are the chances of my wife and I, or at least my wife, having the opportunity to meet you personally and address some issues as long as others are present so as to keep it ethical?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  God bless.

they have been doing for years.
	I urge you to see Time magazine May 21st issue.  "Schools That
Stretch"  Time has named the best school in the country - The Accelerated
School in South Central Los Angeles as the winner and the best school in the
country.  It is a charter school--and it has low income and minority

	That proves to me that great things can be accomplished in charter

years.

Dear Governor: 
You might be surprised that I am writing to you twice in one day.  I might be 
getting into a delicate area but I am going to venture on this path because I 
feel strongly about some things and above all I do not want to hear any 
criticisms about your  leadership. 
I was called by a friend that serves with me on a Board of Directors here in 
Miami. She asked me to write to you to see if you could rethink your decision 
to cut the budget on a social program. Best Buddies. As you know there are 
more than 7.5 million people with mental retardation in the United States, 
many in our State. We are very lucky because we have no one in our families 
with this problem. This program is really providing a very needed service. 
They are very successful educating high schools, college students, corporate, 
community citizens and employers about the needs and abilities of people with 
mental retardation. There have been many mentally retarded individuals that 
have been able to be integrated to their communities, thanks to this program. 
Would you be able to do something about this? I hope you can. I think that 
what they are asking from our State is around $115,000. 
I know you probably get many requests like this but I hope that you can make 
a difference by helping those who really need your attention.

cut will cripple their program.  Given the emphasis that the Surgeon
General has placed on children's health and mental health, I can't

Governor Bush:

I am a National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Child Health and 
Human
Development Fellow in Pediatric Psychology at the Mailman Center for Child
Development in Miami. I formerly served as a Clinical Child/Pediatric 
Psychology
Intern at the Center. It has come to my attention that you are considering 
a veto
of appropriations that provide a major source of funding for our programs. 
I strongly
urge you to consider the impact this will have on the children of Florida, 
as well as on
children of the U.S. who benefit from the expertise derived by trainees 
such as
myself who go on to positions in academic and clinical settings across the 
Nation.
In my roles here I have provided clinical services to children with chronic 
and
terminal illnesses such as cancer, sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, hemophilia,
cystric fibrosis, asthma, and a variety of other conditions or disorders. The
impact the services here have on these families, and consequently on the
greater health, educational, and community systems of our State and Nation
are immeasurable and invaluable.

Through services offered here children and families are able to cope with 
challenges
that arise, but are also able to learn ways of preventing potential 
problems and
pitfalls from occurring. Research is continually emerging related to the 
medical
cost offset and other savings that result from such efforts, and I urge you 
to recognize
these and to recognize the devastating impact a decision to veto 
appropriations
could have on our many systems that are involved here. Most especially, 
consider
the impact on a child with a severe developmental delay or neurocognitive 
deficits
resulting from treatment for a brain tumor. Consider the benefits these 
children have
of receiving coordinated, multi-disciplinary care that cuts across systems: 
health,
educational, family, and community.

A veto of this legislation would be a devastating blow, the wake of which 
would
carry miles beyond South Florida, Tallahassee, state lines, or even 
international
boundaries. The power lies with you and I urge you to exercise that power 
cautiously
and judiciously.

With Sincerest Concern,

Subject: Funding for the Empowerment Alliance


On behalf of the Empowerment Alliance of Southwest Florida, I would like to thank you for your support of our legislative funding request this year.  This funding is extremely important to provide the needed staff resources and to leverage other funding dollars.  In the past 1 1/2 years we have been able to leverage over $28 million dollars in other funding for projects into the rural areas of Hendry County, Immokalee, and the Seminole Indian Tribe.  We are also working with the Community Foundation of Collier County to begin an endowment campaign with private foundations and corporations.  The Immokalee Community has filed for the Florida Front Porch Initiative this cycle and is also applying for recognition as a Weed & Seed site under the US Department of Justice.   
 
We hope to invite you to several ground breaking ceremonies over the next 3 months including: the Immokalee One Stop Center, the 300 bed dormitory for farmworkers (with funding secured by your direct efforts), 40 single family units for homeownership and the RCMA Charter School.   
 
We appreciate your support and look forward to a visit when your schedule permits.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Barbara A. Cacchione, Enterprise Community Coordinator

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Dear Honorable Governor Bush and Cabinet Members: I urge you to consider strongly the ideals and philosophies of each of the candidates for the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol. I personally would like to recommend to you Chief Christopher Knight. I first had the opportunity to meet with Chief Knight while he was the Chief Training Officer at the Florida Highway Patrol Training Academy. It only took a quick moment for me to realize the professionalism and knowledge that Chief Knight bestowed on myself and others at the Academy. Chief Knight is a highly respected leader within the Florida Highway Patrol. I have heard many positive aspects of Chief Knight, and I'm sure you are aware of these as well. I believe that Chief Knight possesses the ability and vision to make the Florida Highway Patrol an ideal progressive law enforcement agency for the future of Florida's government and the citizens of the state of Florida. I believe that in selecting Chief Knight as the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol, you will have certainly made a wise decision. Thank you for your time and May God Bless you in your decision making process.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

This Chief will make the best choice because he still is young and bright. He is very organized and people friendly. We need somone with skills to deal with todays problems and help the highway patrol move forward. We for so long have not been able to accomplish many of the goals the patrol was set out to do because of old thinking. Chris brings fresh air to the program. I really do believe that he can and will make a difference.

Governor Bush,
 
I have just been informed that state funding for the Mailman Center is included in your veto list.  I am a graduate student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Miami.  The Mailman Center has provided me with top notch training on developmental disabilities pertinent to my career track.  I have also been able to refer children with developmental disabilities to the Mailman center for services.  
 
The programs available at the Mailman Center, not only for training new professionals, such as myself, but also for helping children with disabilities lead a more normal life, are of fundamental importance to residents of Florida.  During my training at the Mailman Center I met parents of children, who if it were not for this center, would be immobile and hopeless. However, the Mailman Center has given these children a new look at life urging them to succeed and helping them to overcome their fears and discouragement. The parents are ever so grateful for the transformations they have experienced in their children's lives.  By placing a veto on the funding for this center you will be destroying  these children's newfound hope as well as the hope of those training to encourage and help them.  
 
I, therefore, ask you to reconsider placing a veto on the funding provided to the Mailman Center.
 
Thank you,
Lisa Lopez

Governor’s fiscal responsibility applauded


Leader Fasano’s statement regarding budget vetoes

 
 
TALLAHASSEE – “I congratulate Governor Bush for having the courage, once again, to set aside politics and prudently wield his veto pen in protection of Florida’s fiscal health,” said House Majority Leader Mike Fasano (R-New Port Richey). “The Governor is the final filter in our budget process, and I am pleased that he takes his responsibility so seriously.
 
“For far too long, projects were funded based upon the sponsor’s political clout. Now, with Governor Bush at the helm and a Republican Legislature, projects are funded based upon their merit and their positive impact upon the entire state. As a fiscal conservative, and someone elected as one, I welcome that change.
 
“As far as the vetoed projects go, next session is just six months away, and I’m quite sure each Representative who had a project vetoed will begin working now to convince the Governor of its vital statewide importance.”

The veto of the line item for the Pompano Sate Farmers Market is to 
commended. Last year over $ 2 million for this useless facility scaped your 
veto. This market has not served any Florida producers for the last 12 years 
or so, Over the last 30 years it has helped a group of 4 or 5 local brokers 
who have enriched themselves on the backs of many small farmers that 
eventualy went broke. Today it only serves brokers and distributors who 
should be relying on their own money and not a state subsidized facility.

     Good job! What a list, but it makes such good sense. I've never
read the complete veto document. The explanations are great. I love it
that you keep killing special pet projects -- particularly the Rodman
Dam stuff. You continue to baffle the environmentalists, who can't blast
all your decision making.
    But what a week to have to come to Volusia County to speak -- after
killing the Speedway overpass?
    My husband is looking forward to hearing your speech Friday night.
He's been a big supporter of yours since the first election, but other
than the Orlando rally last fall, he's never heard you speak in person.
I talked the Volusia County Medical Examiner and his wife into going
with us. He's a big fan of yours too. I made the reporter who's covering
it promise not to tell everyone that he saw me there. I was on the
Republican Executive Committee when I went to work for the paper in
1991, but they made me quit. Imagine that!

As a concerned citizen, I am writing to ask that you not veto the funding for the Hibiscus Crisis Nursery Program (CNP) in Stuart, FL.  As one of thousands of Treasure Coast residents who lend their support to Hibiscus, I applaud the 90 percent success rate of their Crisis Nursery Program.  Last year, this program saved close to 1500 children from the foster care system.  In addition, the CNP has been providing technical assistance in creating and replicating their nationally acclaimed model to organizations in over 7 counties across the State of Florida.  By virtue of its success, CNP saves government dollars in a big way!  Please don't veto the funding of this critical program.

Jeb,  I guess that you're not resting yet due to all the mail I bet you're
getting on key (or probably everybody's personal) issues.  I haven't been
resting either, tho I am getting a bit frustrated with the inertia of the
state system.  We've got an inspiring leader but the day to day operations
are like wading thru jelled jello (not that I've actually done that).

First, I hope you keep Medipass at $3/visit.  Health Dept's provide an
impressive array of services to a very needy population that would result in
greater expense if not served. On the other hand, we can probably ( I
originally said certainly but the state requirements throw impediments in
our path like requiring us to fill out the same information on 3 different
forms) be more productive.  We do need better management reporting
mechanisms (other than HCMS).  It's one thing to say do better but it's
another to show it.

2) billboards--I know Republicans (and I am one--and have been one forever)
often retreat to "private property rights" when faced with Growth Mgmt or
other property issues (and I am really sorry we couldn't pass an
accountability bill, i.e., cost accountability for growth or add schools
into the equation) but I believe that when an area passes a billboard policy
(like St John's County) that the Legislature should not override it as they
did with the Billboard legislation slated for your pen.

3)negative formulary--I've spoken to a number of my friends on this issue
(like docs and John Thrasher)and despite some of their obvious lobbying
interests, agree that we should not force pharmacists to change the
prescriptions of docs to the generic. Perhaps this bill could pass next year
with a few caveats like, notification to physicians so they are aware and
can write the Rx accordingly; notices that pharmacies have to post telling
clients about required generic substitutions; and some requirement that
pharmacies can't go with the generic of the month (I'm also a nurse with an
80 yr old mom who is completely confused each month with the different
generics she ends up with--I was even confused when I picked up her last
meds).

Sorry for such a long message.  Hope all is well.

Issue of the day (for me)--Growth Mgmt (tho Planning for Growth is better
terminology).  I've been involved on the grassroots level thru my
neighborhood & CPAC (citizens planning advisory council) for 5-6 yrs.  For
the last 5 months, I've been participating in a Jacksonville Community
Council Inc study on "Growth Mgmt" with weekly mtgs & resource speakers.

Throughout it all, whether our state or local planning system has any teeth
or not, I have a philosophical question--does a property owner who wants to
change the feel/makeup/ambience/neighborhood identity by rezoning his
property say, to higher density residential, business park, commercial...
have the right to do so... or... do the people who live in that community
have the right to maintain the feel.//.neighborhood identity?  I've heard
several people report on your Growth Mgmt task force and what I hear is that
we need to maintain a balance--which is rather a vague charge.

I am very heartened by your desire to quantify the impact of development
thru cost accounting and think this would reduce the mystique around the
process.  Information is a valuable tool, not the whole answer, but a tool.

One other point and I'll let you go--is that in your GM Task Force and many
local endeavors, the results stress the need for local input.  I
respectively tell you that I have not seen a good local process.  Here,
people point to the CPAC as the people's input opportunity but the tired,
overworked volunteers have neither the time or the training to be effective.
The process is complicated and too long (and costly)--for both developers
and non-developers.  It needs streamlining, simplifying and the addition of
an ombudsman at the local level.  I know many of these issues are local but
I hope the State sets up sufficient guidelines to safeguard the general
public if political will is not in their favor.

I sat next to Al Cardenas at the Ponte Vedra Rep Dinner and felt guilty for
not addressing this yet, so here goes:  Altho many insurance programs don't
cover preventive care, the cost : benefit ratios to the individual for
prevention have been conclusively proven.  Prevention programs in particular
(and health programs in general) should be a priority at a time when Florida
ranks in the lowest quartile in the country for virtually all health
indicators.

Family planning services are being reduced by approx 1.2 million dollars.
This will result in increased uncompensated costs for deliveries, the care
for unwanted children, increased infant mortality, etc.

Family Health Services were reduced by $5million.  This includes school
health services (I did some school health nursing through Georgetown U. in
Washington, DC), chronic disease screening and education services, KidCare
outreach, dental...

---Using Duval county, we currently have a nurse to pupil ratio of 1:5000.
Many of the antecedents for school failure result from poor health status
and this is a natural place for early intervention.

---Chronic diseases, if left unidentified and untreated, result in increased
morbidity & costs (compared to early treatment).

---Dental care remains unavailable to the majority of FL citizens.  More
than half of children receiving Medicaid do not have access to dental care.
& the majority of uninsured adults don't either.  This can lead to
nutritional and gastrointestinal problems and an overall decrease in quality
of life.

I've been part of the health care community for years and know many
excellent, hard working, altruistic doctors, administrators and support
people working in the trenches to provide better healthcare to needy people.
We have the best medical care in the world but need to move from a largely
medical model to a preventive and empowering model.  Look at the great
strides we made in smoking cessation in the last 25 years.  Think of the
last time you went to Europe and had to wade thru all the smokers.  Come to
Jax and I'll show you around our Health Centers.

I'm off to Tallahassee tomorrow for Sen Horne's Fl Educ Funding Formula Task
Force. Take care. Holly

to the FEFP.  A friend of mine just moved from Jax to Miami and wrote me
telling how great the schools were--that they had PE every day and music and
art teachers!! (Here in Jax Beach, they had PE 1-2 times/ wk and no art (not
enuf funding).  Interesting and timely anecdote.

    My husband is looking forward to hearing your speech Friday night.
He's been a big supporter of yours since the first election, but other
than the Orlando rally last fall, he's never heard you speak in person.
I talked the Volusia County Medical Examiner and his wife into going

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I've known each of the three chiefs for 15+ years. All three have fine qualities, but in order to restore pride and integrity to the FHP I believe only Chris Knight has the vision and the ability needed. I am concerned with Fred Dickinson picking the leader of the largest State Law Enforcement agency in Florida. He has exhibited his distaste for FHP for years and has not done anything to encourage professionalism. This has recently been shown with the selection of Billy Dickson to lead the search team as it is well known knowledge that he is in support of Jim Lee. Chief Knight's attributes are his integrity, ability to communicate with people of all levels and to actively listen all. He considers all ideas and gives credit where credit is due. He is a trooper's trooper. He has proven he only wants the best for the FHP. His selection will enhance the FHP and without his leadership we will continue to sink as we have for the past 3 1/2 years.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to ask you to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from consideration for a veto.  As a doctoral student in Clinical-Child Psychology at the University of Miami, I have learned a great deal and participated in exceptional experiences as a trainee at the Mailman Center.  These experiences will help me when I am applying for internship and eventually when I am in the market for a job.  The work that I have been involved in at the Mailman Center has been an incredible hands-on learning experience that I could not have participated in without state funding.  If this money is taken away from this facility, not only will students like me suffer because their training will not be as exceptional, but the children who we provide services to will suffer as well.  It breaks my heart to see these children in the states they are in when I begin to treat them in therapy. Without this treatment, as well as the many medical treatments they receive, they will be missing out on a chance to better their lives.  Therefore I am asking you again to please withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from veto.

What about the major increases in social service funding? The budget grew by $2.6 billion and the tax reduction was $180 million. Don't you think this is the right balance?

Governor Bush, citizens surely applaud you for being vociferous in vetoing 
any capricious projects which are pork barrel items.  However, after going 
over the items, I feel very upset over the very necessary human service items 
which you have nixed in order to give a tax refund to citizens of a state 
that has a very generous-and outdated-taxing system already.  The refund will 
not help me significantly but will impact thousands of lives in a negative 
way.  I am very disappointed in you.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to encourage you to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation
from consideration for a veto.

The loss in funding would decimate training, clinical services, and
research.  This would severely impact services in psychology, social work,
nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language
therapy, pediatrics, dentistry, and education to more than 13,000 children
with developmental disabilities and serious childhood illnesses. This
represents approximately 1/3 of the children in Florida who have these
illnesses or disabilities.

Please help these children and their families by withdrawing your veto
that would cancel the funds to the Mailman Center.

I fully appreciate the inequity of the current system which is why we have proposed its change to have one % for all counties and a waiver of that requirement for economic disadvantaged counties. The money in the budget is from the Healthy Kids reserve which means this would only be a one time deal. Better to come up with a common sense approach that allows for creative ways to get the local match. 

I am sorry you are disturbed but under our leadership, the number of uninsured kids has dropped dramatically. I am proud of this record and know that you will continue to do great work in Escambia County.

It disturbs me to hear that you have plans to veto the State portion of 
Healthy Kids as it applies to Escambia County. You are sufficiently 
informed that this assessment is imposed in a most inequitable. Escambia 
County by some rare formula is only one of two counties in all of Florida 
that is expected to raise these as volunteers dollars from among its 
constituents. Healthy Kids is one of the most cost effective prevention 
tools we have after immunization. To through these children into the 
emergency rooms when their diseases become unmanageable is clearly an 
injustice when a much more cost effective solution is available.

Escambia will probably, with great effort and many, many "man" hours rally 
to the cause. Many of those hours will draw state employees from other 
important work for a cause that they feel in their hearts for their friends 
and neighbors in this community. There is no way that I can see your 
proposed veto action as anything but short-sighted.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am a registered voter in the state of Florida and am writing to you
today with deep concern regarding your decision to veto the state's
funding of the Mailman Center for Child Development in
Miami.  My association with the Mailman Center was first as an emplyee of
one of it's large-scale research projects and then later as a clinical
psychology trainee while completing my doctoral degree at the University
of Miami.  From my personal experience, the services provided by the
Mailman Center are bar none, the most comprehensive in Miami-Dade County.
Furthermore, the multidisciplinary nature of the program has benefited
many of the most needy (economically, physically, and developmentally). I
can also tell you, from having recently completed job interviews at the
nations top hospitals and medical schools (i.e. Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC , Rush
Presbyterian St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Brown University, Stanford
University, the University of Chicago, and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill) that the Mailman Center is highly esteemed for
both its service and its training programs.  Eliminating the funding that
the state provides to the Mailman Center would only serve to undermine
these nationally recongized and highly successful service and training
programs.  Furthermore, I can promise that if you do decide to veto this
funding, my faith in your ability to govern effectively and humanely would
be undermined.  As a result, I would not be able to vote for you should
you decide to run for re-election.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
A. Rebecca Neal

It truly is an exceptional program that needs to be better promoted (which we are doing more of).  To that end, I would very much like to sit down with you and discuss the auxiliary and what we can do to enhance our services.  This is merely an offer (that won't be made again because I don't want to be troublesome) that will await your response.
 
In the meantime, Governor, as I mentioned to you in my e-mail last week, Lt. Gov. Brogan was the keynote speaker at our annual training meeting June 2.  He spoke to a crowd of over 500 (members, family and FHP staff).  We would like to extend the offer to you next year.  It's a forum that will put you in contact with folks from the Keys to Pensacola.

Dear Governor Bush: 

My name is David Coley and I am the Legislative Assistant to Rep. Allan Bense.  I'm writing to you today concerning the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary (FHPA) and the budget item in the 2001 Appropriations Act to standardize weapons.  I understand through talking with Sarah Voyle that you have expressed concern about this provision.

Since Ms. Voyle did not say specifically what your concerns are, I will attempt to briefly explain to you why this funding (which was sponsored by Rep. Bense and Sen. Charlie Clary and approved by DHSMV and FHP) is good public policy.

First, let me tell you that I am a 16 year member of the Auxiliary.  When I applied in 1986, I had to go through the same application process that a "regular" trooper had to go through.  That included physicals, eye exams, and background investigations.  I had to pay for my own training at Chipola Junior College, buy my own uniform (including weapon) and all of the leather gear that is required.  In 1986 that cost me approximately $1,000.

I'm sure that you are aware that the FHPA is authorized in statute (we have full arrest powers while under the supervision of troopers).  Currently, we have approximately 375 members.  Last year our members (male and female) spent over 161,000 hours volunteering law enforcement services to the state of Florida, FHP and the motoring public.  Both Fred Dickinson and Col. Curt Hall will tell you that we provide the equivalent of 100 full time troopers - without pay.

While our primary duty is to ride with a trooper and provide back up and support, we have performed other duties, as well.  Our members assist the patrol every year with the Black College Reunion, bringing in over 100 FHPA personnel to supplement a small FHP staffing, so troopers can stay in their district and do their job.  During the wild fire season three years ago, our members provided crucial staffing that allowed troopers to stay on the road.  During hurricanes, our members patrol the interstate, assisting stranded motorists, so troopers can work traffic crashes and perform enforcement activities.

This year, we had a FHPA trooper save the life of a 6 year old child while patrolling I-95.  The child, who was not breathing, had wrapped and knotted a seatbelt around his neck and engaged the locking mechanism. When the call for help came in, there was not a location given.  The auxiliary trooper, who was the only law enforcement officer on the interstate at that time, began searching for the vehicle and found it literally minutes before the child suffocated.  After calling for help, he went back to the victim and was able to wedge his fingers between the belt and the child's throat to restore breathing.  Ten minutes after the auxiliary trooper arrived, a full time trooper arrived and was able to cut the seat belt.  When paramedics arrived 22 minutes after the original response, they advised that the child would have likely died if the auxiliary member had not been out patrolling that day.

Governor, that is just one story.  We have had "volunteers" deliver babies in the back seat of patrol cars; rescue families from burning buildings; and jump into the Gulf of Mexico and save drowning victims, recover stolen vehicles and stop and detain DUI drivers.  But perhaps more importantly, these are volunteers who not only risk their lives everyday just like a full time officer.  They respond to interstate call boxes and end up changing a tire for an elderly couple, or getting a can of gas for a teenage girl traveling home from an activity.

I'm pretty sure that you don't have a problem with the program itself, but I thought it was important to give you some actual instances of what these "volunteers" do.

I'm assuming that you have a problem with the purchase of the weapons.  Auxiliary troopers (deputies and police officers) are already given authority through statute to carry weapons.  We are trained exactly like "regular" law enforcement officers.  As required by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission we have to qualify twice annually.  In addition, the patrol requires both troopers and auxiliary troopers to demonstrate proficiency in weapon retention.

I mentioned to you earlier that when I was accepted into the program 16 years ago, I was required to purchase all of my equipment, my uniform, gun and leather and pay for all of the application requirements.  That holds true today except for a couple of provisions (the patrol has been able to pay for training and uniform expenses) Since 1994, the Legislature has provided funds to assist members in this endeavor.  Our initial appropriation was for $50,000 (interestingly enough sponsored by Rep. Sally Heyman).  Over the years, I have worked to have that increased to $150,000.

Last year, Rep. Bense and Sen. W.D. Childers, with the approval of FHP, placed an additional $200,000 to purchase the same weapon that troopers use (Beretta 96G 40 cal.) for the auxiliary trooper.  However, there was a glitch that prevented the patrol from utilizing the funds.  The patrol was, however, able to find funds to buy 116 weapons for new members - since during their recruiting period they were told they would be issued the guns. So, the project is already ongoing, it just needs to be completed.

There are two crucial issues here.  First, the weapon used by the patrol is quite expensive (approximately $700) and cannot be readily purchased.  It is specially made for FHP and Beretta will not manufacture the gun until a certain number is ordered.  This prohibits the auxiliary from recruiting, since a perspective member has no assurance that he can begin service after training if he can't get a weapon right away.

Second, auxiliary troopers currently have three types of weapons in the field: a revolver, a 9mm Beretta (the patrol's old weapon) and the 96G 40 cal.  As an issue of safety it is crucial that personnel have the same weapon, so that if there is an incident involving an extended shoot out, officers could share weapons, magazines and bullets.

Since I pointed out to you before, I think you should know that I already own and carry a Beretta 96G.  Several members made a block purchase when the patrol made the transition in 1997.  That would boost my cost of being a member of FHPA to approximately $1,700.  Last year, I volunteered over 1,000 hours working to protect the motorists of Florida.  We do have several members who regularly volunteers up to 3,000 hours.  The average activity for a member is approximately 300 hours a year.

Governor, these guns will be the property of FHP and the state of Florida.  They will be issued to the auxiliary troopers and they will have semi-annual training.  In the over 40 years of the FHPA, there has never been an accidental shooting by our members.  Weapons have been used to apprehend felons, however.

Just last week, Lt. Gov. Brogan was the keynote speaker at our Annual Training Meeting in Orlando.  He can attest to you the dedication of the men and women of the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary.  Before making your decision, I would respectfully ask you to talk to Capt. Tony Allen, your FDLE escorts and other troopers assigned to the Governor's office to discuss the invaluable service we provide to the state.  Additionally (and this may be out of the ordinary), I am available to discuss this with you - it truly is a great program and a win for the state.  From a liability perspective, the use of our personal weapons is already covered, so there is no new burden on the state.  

Sir, I know this letter is long, but I believe you needed to have a complete history of what brought this appropriation about.  I urge you to allow the appropriation to remain in the budget.  I truly believe that if you veto the item a large number of members will transfer to Sheriff's offices or Police Departments which already provide weapons, training, and uniforms to their members.  This will not only add an extra burden to the patrol, but will take a volunteer off the highway that just might be the guy who prevents a 6-year-old child from suffocating because there was no one close by to assist.

Respectfully yours, 

David Coley

That holds true today except for a couple of provisions (the patrol has been able to pay for training and uniform expenses) Since 1994, the Legislature has provided funds to assist members in this endeavor.  Our initial appropriation was for $50,000 (interestingly enough sponsored by Rep. Sally Heyman).  Over the years, I have worked to have that increased to $150,000.

Last year, Rep. Bense and Sen. W.D. Childers, with the approval of FHP, placed an additional $200,000 to purchase the same weapon that troopers use (Beretta 96G 40 cal.) for the auxiliary trooper.  However, there was a glitch that prevented the patrol from utilizing the funds.  The patrol was, however, able to find funds to buy 116 weapons for new members - since during their recruiting period they were told they would be issued the guns. So, the project is already ongoing, it just needs to be completed.

There are two crucial issues here.  First, the weapon used by the patrol is quite expensive (approximately $700) and cannot be readily purchased.  It is specially made for FHP and Beretta will not manufacture the gun until a certain number is ordered.  This prohibits the auxiliary from recruiting, since a perspective member has no assurance that he can begin service after training if he can't get a weapon right away.

Second, auxiliary troopers currently have three types of weapons in the field: a revolver, a 9mm Beretta (the patrol's old weapon) and the 96G 40 cal.  As an issue of safety it is crucial that personnel have the same weapon, so that if there is an incident involving an extended shoot out, officers could share weapons, magazines and bullets.

Since I pointed out to you before, I think you should know that I already own and carry a Beretta 96G.  Several members made a block purchase when the patrol made the transition in 1997.  That would boost my cost of being a member of FHPA to approximately $1,700.  Last year, I volunteered over 1,000 hours working to protect the motorists of Florida.  We do have several members who regularly volunteers up to 3,000 hours.  The average activity for a member is approximately 300 hours a year.

Governor, these guns will be the property of FHP and the state of Florida.  They will be issued to the auxiliary troopers and they will have semi-annual training.  In the over 40 years of the FHPA, there has never been an accidental shooting by our members.  Weapons have been used to apprehend felons, however.

Just last week, Lt. Gov. Brogan was the keynote speaker at our Annual Training Meeting in Orlando.  He can attest to you the dedication of the men and women of the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary.  Before making your decision, I would respectfully ask you to talk to Capt. Tony Allen, your FDLE escorts and other troopers assigned to the Governor's office to discuss the invaluable service we provide to the state.  Additionally (and this may be out of the ordinary), I am available to discuss this with you - it truly is a great program and a win for the state.  From a liability perspective, the use of our personal weapons is already covered, so there is no new burden on the state.  

Sir, I know this letter is long, but I believe you needed to have a complete history of what brought this appropriation about.  I urge you to allow the appropriation to remain in the budget.  I truly believe that if you veto the item a large number of members will transfer to Sheriff's offices or Police Departments which already provide weapons, training, and uniforms to their members.  This will not only add an extra burden to the patrol, but will take a volunteer off the highway that just might be the guy who prevents a 6-year-old child from suffocating because there was no one close by to assist.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to encourage you to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation
from consideration for a veto.

The loss in funding would decimate training, clinical services, and
research.  This would severely impact services in psychology, social work,
nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language
therapy, pediatrics, dentistry, and education to more than 13,000 children
with developmental disabilities and serious childhood illnesses. This
represents approximately 1/3 of the children in Florida who have these
illnesses or disabilities.

Please help these children and their families by withdrawing your veto
that would cancel the funds to the Mailman Center.

Thank you,

It disturbs me to hear that you have plans to veto the State portion of 
Healthy Kids as it applies to Escambia County. You are sufficiently 
informed that this assessment is imposed in a most inequitable. Escambia 
County by some rare formula is only one of two counties in all of Florida 
that is expected to raise these as volunteers dollars from among its 
constituents. Healthy Kids is one of the most cost effective prevention 
tools we have after immunization. To through these children into the 
emergency rooms when their diseases become unmanageable is clearly an 
injustice when a much more cost effective solution is available.

Escambia will probably, with great effort and many, many "man" hours rally 
to the cause. Many of those hours will draw state employees from other 
important work for a cause that they feel in their hearts for their friends 
and neighbors in this community. There is no way that I can see your 
proposed veto action as anything but short-sighted.

TALLAHASSEE – “I congratulate Governor Bush for having the courage, once again, to set aside politics and prudently wield his veto pen in protection of Florida’s fiscal health,” said House Majority Leader Mike Fasano (R-New Port Richey). “The Governor is the final filter in our budget process, and I am pleased that he takes his responsibility so seriously.
 
“For far too long, projects were funded based upon the sponsor’s political clout. Now, with Governor Bush at the helm and a Republican Legislature, projects are funded based upon their merit and their positive impact upon the entire state. As a fiscal conservative, and someone elected as one, I welcome that change.
 
“As far as the vetoed projects go, next session is just six months away, and I’m quite sure each Representative who had a project vetoed will begin working now to convince the Governor of its vital statewide importance.”

Subject:	Mailman Center Funding Veto


Dear Governor Bush,

I am a registered voter in the state of Florida and am writing to you
today with deep concern regarding your decision to veto the state's
funding of the Mailman Center for Child Development in
Miami.  My association with the Mailman Center was first as an emplyee of
one of it's large-scale research projects and then later as a clinical
psychology trainee while completing my doctoral degree at the University
of Miami.  From my personal experience, the services provided by the
Mailman Center are bar none, the most comprehensive in Miami-Dade County.
Furthermore, the multidisciplinary nature of the program has benefited
many of the most needy (economically, physically, and developmentally). I
can also tell you, from having recently completed job interviews at the
nations top hospitals and medical schools (i.e. Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC , Rush
Presbyterian St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Brown University, Stanford
University, the University of Chicago, and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill) that the Mailman Center is highly esteemed for
both its service and its training programs.  Eliminating the funding that
the state provides to the Mailman Center would only serve to undermine
these nationally recongized and highly successful service and training
programs.  Furthermore, I can promise that if you do decide to veto this
funding, my faith in your ability to govern effectively and humanely would
be undermined.  As a result, I would not be able to vote for you should
you decide to run for re-election.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
A. Rebecca Neal

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to ask you to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from consideration for a veto.  As a doctoral student in Clinical-Child Psychology at the University of Miami, I have learned a great deal and participated in exceptional experiences as a trainee at the Mailman Center.  These experiences will help me when I am applying for internship and eventually when I am in the market for a job.  The work that I have been involved in at the Mailman Center has been an incredible hands-on learning experience that I could not have participated in without state funding.  If this money is taken away from this facility, not only will students like me suffer because their training will not be as exceptional, but the children who we provide services to will suffer as well.  It breaks my heart to see these children in the states they are in when I begin to treat them in therapy. Without this treatment, as well as the many medical treatments they receive, they will be missing out on a chance to better their lives.  Therefore I am asking you again to please withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from veto.

Governor Bush,
 
I have just been informed that state funding for the Mailman Center is included in your veto list.  I am a graduate student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Miami.  The Mailman Center has provided me with top notch training on developmental disabilities pertinent to my career track.  I have also been able to refer children with developmental disabilities to the Mailman center for services.  
 
The programs available at the Mailman Center, not only for training new professionals, such as myself, but also for helping children with disabilities lead a more normal life, are of fundamental importance to residents of Florida.  During my training at the Mailman Center I met parents of children, who if it were not for this center, would be immobile and hopeless. However, the Mailman Center has given these children a new look at life urging them to succeed and helping them to overcome their fears and discouragement. The parents are ever so grateful for the transformations they have experienced in their children's lives.  By placing a veto on the funding for this center you will be destroying  these children's newfound hope as well as the hope of those training to encourage and help them.  
 
I, therefore, ask you to reconsider placing a veto on the funding provided to the Mailman Center.
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to urge your including the full appropriation for the Ringling
Museum in the budget.

The Ringling Museum as reorganized under Florida State University continues
as a state treasure, serving as repository of some of the finest art in the
world and importantly, with the plans at hand and the funding appropriated
by the Legislature, stands on the verge of national and international
prominence which will enhance Florida's reputation for arts and culture and
attract additional tourism dollars to our state's economy.

Both for local and statewide interests, I hope you will find your way clear
to include the entire appropriation in the budget.

Respectfully,

Dear Jeb,

     I am aware that you are considering a veto for the funding for the 
University of Miami's  Mailman Center for Child Development.

     I know that you have received numerous e-mails from the people we 
serve from throughout Florida.  This Center is of broad importance to the 
people of Florida, and provides very special services for children who have 
very special needs.   Most of these children have nowhere else to go for 
these services.  They are poor, and have very complex problems.  We provide 
countless hours of advice and service to other agencies under this state 
funding.

      If you review the Agency priorities for the Department of Health as 
submitted in their Legislative Budget Requests, the Mailman Center provides 
services, training, and other services in virtually every priority area 
that the Department of Health lists, such as providing a coordinated system 
of care for children with special health care needs. The list goes on, and on.

      In fact, the plan for the upcoming Mailman Center-CMS contract 
includes development of MCHB required quality assurance outcomes for 
state-wide case management, which will be essential in our efforts to 
consider privatization of certain aspects of CMS.

       A veto of this legislation will without question stop many critical 
programs for disadvantaged children. While many have focused on the service 
aspects of the Mailman Center, please be clear that this is in reality a 
major infrastructure appropriation with far reaching consequences across 
the state.   It is the core funding for this vital center.

      There simply is no other funding mechanism for these state-wide needs.


Sincerely yours,

Rod Howell

I gave Senator Lee his final list this morning...he was out of town yesterday.  I have been telling you what a great attitude he continues to have, so I made no appeals on his behalf, even though he did not get any of his top priorities.  He said he will be supportive.  But I would like to appeal the Brandon Main Street project (2946 A 2 $600,000).  It is vetoed because it is in the secretary of state's budget, and really is a downtown revitalization project.  

FYI, he thinks you should veto the booster seat bill...now that he is back home and surrounded by soccer moms, he is hearing a lot of negative comments

State employees freed from 


one-size-fits-all retirement plan

 
 
TALLAHASSEE – Part of Senate Bill 2, signed into law by Governor Jeb Bush Thursday, will give state employees more options in investing for their retirement.  
 
The bill, as amended by House Majority Leader Mike Fasano (R-New Port Richey), will allow Florida teachers, police officers, firefighters and other participants in the Florida Retirement System to invest their retirement dollars in much the same manner as private sector employees with a 401K retirement plan. The new law also requires that the person in charge of administering the FRS be evaluated each year. 
 
“We are finally respecting the intelligence of our state employees by giving them the freedom to make their own investment decisions,” said Fasano. “They can stay in their current plan and have the security of a set retirement benefit, or they can take control of their retirement fund, invest it wisely and work toward greater returns.
 
“We are also going to evaluate the head of the State Board of Administration each year.  Our teachers, police, firefighters and other employees work hard and deserve to enjoy their retirement years. It is only right that the one person in charge of close to $100 billion in retirement investments be held accountable to the people whose fate he holds in his hands.”

Dear Governor Bush:
This letter is in reference to your plan to veto appropriations for the
Mailman Center for Child Development.  As a child psychologist who
received my degree for University of Miami, and who trained at the Mailman
Center, I understand how important the programs at the Mailman Center are
for training new child psychologists, and providing needed services to the
underpriveledged children of Miami and surrounding areas.  This funding
cut will cripple their program.  Given the emphasis that the Surgeon
General has placed on children's health and mental health, I can't
understand why you would make a decision that would hurt both, not only in
the present, but in the years to come because of a lack of trained
professionals.  Thank you or your time and consideration.

My husband and I were so excited when we bought our "zero" lot line house on Jones Creek.  We didn't really know what Jones Creek was at the time except it meant no neighbors behind us and a nice view.  However, when the water became low (even before the drought) a terrible smell would fill the house.  The first time there was a bad smell I thought the dog had done her business.  When I went looking for a "pile" I couldn't find one.  Then realizing it was coming from the creek I had to close the doors and windows and turn the air conditioning on.  When the wind blows towards our house it is never pleasant.  Jones Creek does need your help.  The "ooze" (bottom sediments) is terrible looking and terrible smelling to the environment and the people.  It's time something gets done.  The money is there!!!!!

Governor Bush:

I am a National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Child Health and 
Human
Development Fellow in Pediatric Psychology at the Mailman Center for Child
Development in Miami. I formerly served as a Clinical Child/Pediatric 
Psychology
Intern at the Center. It has come to my attention that you are considering 
a veto
of appropriations that provide a major source of funding for our programs. 
I strongly
urge you to consider the impact this will have on the children of Florida, 
as well as on
children of the U.S. who benefit from the expertise derived by trainees 
such as
myself who go on to positions in academic and clinical settings across the 
Nation.
In my roles here I have provided clinical services to children with chronic 
and
terminal illnesses such as cancer, sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, hemophilia,
cystric fibrosis, asthma, and a variety of other conditions or disorders. The
impact the services here have on these families, and consequently on the
greater health, educational, and community systems of our State and Nation
are immeasurable and invaluable.

Through services offered here children and families are able to cope with 
challenges
that arise, but are also able to learn ways of preventing potential 
problems and
pitfalls from occurring. Research is continually emerging related to the 
medical
cost offset and other savings that result from such efforts, and I urge you 
to recognize
these and to recognize the devastating impact a decision to veto 
appropriations
could have on our many systems that are involved here. Most especially, 
consider
the impact on a child with a severe developmental delay or neurocognitive 
deficits
resulting from treatment for a brain tumor. Consider the benefits these 
children have
of receiving coordinated, multi-disciplinary care that cuts across systems: 
health,
educational, family, and community.

A veto of this legislation would be a devastating blow, the wake of which 
would
carry miles beyond South Florida, Tallahassee, state lines, or even 
international
boundaries. The power lies with you and I urge you to exercise that power 
cautiously
and judiciously.

With Sincerest Concern,

Honorable Governor Bush,
                     I strongly urge you to withdraw  mailman Center
appropriation from consideration for a veto. This grant is vital  for
continuation of MCHB LEND grant which is the foundation for all training,
service and research programs in Mailman Center. Through this aid from State
of Florida Mailman Center has provided training and clinical services to
more than 13000 children with Developmental disabilities, this represent 1/3
of the children in Florida who have  chronic illnesses and disabilities.
loss of the grant will disrupt this very important program and service in
the State of Florida.
                                                 Sincerely Yours,

                                                      Dr. Juliet Hananian

I see no reason for the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind to receive
$42 million, especially when most of it will be used for cosmetic
improvements to the facility (i.e., buying nearby nice homes, demolishing
them, removing taxable property from the tax rolls, and replacing them with
a "nicer" entrance to the school), and not for educational purposes. Please
know that not everyone in St. Johns County supports the D&B school's plans.
Thanks.

Dear Governor Bush,
It has come to my attention that funding for the Mailman 
Center, affiliated with the University of Miami, is in 
jeapardy.  As an upper level graduate student at the 
University of Florida, I have had an opportunity to 
collaborate with faculty at the Mailman Center, and 
therefore I know the important services they provide to 
the community.  The program at the Mailman 
Center has a nationwide reputation, and if funds 
are cut, the program will likely be unable to 
operate.  Graduate training and public service on behalf 
of Florida's sick children would be hurt by this funding 
cut.  Please reconsider.

Thank you,

I have been with the Florida Highway Patrol for the last twenty five years and have found Chief Knight to be a bright spot in the Patrol's leadership. He has shown true leadership and wisdom while making some tough choices. Even though I might not have agreed with all of his decisions, he has always been able to show that his decisions were made after consideration of all viewpoints. I believe that Chief Kinght is the best person to lead the Patrol forward as he has the support of the field troops, public, and the administration. Thank you for your time in reading this.

Subject:	Mailman Center Veto

Dear Governor Bush,

I am a graduate student at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA., where I am
obtaining my Ph.D. in clinical psychology. This fall, I will be training at
the Mailman Center, an opportunity made possible through the very support
you are proposing to veto. If the state funding for the Mailman Center is
lost, it will severely impact the program, and it is possible that it may
not be able to operate. This will result in many students like myself unable
to train at one of my most prestigious and reputable programs in the
country. In the field of child psychology, the Mailman Center is THE place
to train, as it is one of the largest and most diverse pediatric programs in
the United States with training provided by top notch professionals whose
accomplishments are exceptional. Thus, I am writing to you to encourage you
to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from consideration for a veto.
The training I will receive at the Mailman Center will no doubt have a
profound effect on my professional career and leadership development, given
that I will be training with outstanding staff and patients. The thought of
losing this opportunity is disheartening, to say the least.

The state funding which the Mailman Center receives is administered in the
form of a contract with Children's Medical Services (CMS) of Florida and
allows the facility to (1) provide training to CMS nurses and social workers
statewide on issues related to developmental disabilities and children with
special health care needs; (2) train more than 70 advanced graduate and
post-graduate students in clinical and leadership skills each year, and (3)
concurrent with the training program, provide clinical services in
psychology, social work, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy,
speech and language therapy, pediatrics, dentistry, and education to more
than 13,000 children with developmental disabilities (e.g., mental
retardation, autism, muscular dystrophy, Craniofacial anomalies) and serious
childhood illnesses (e.g. cancer, sickle cell disease, diabetes, HIV,
asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.).  This represents approximately 1/3 of the
children in Florida who have these illnesses or disabilities.

Loss of this grant will likely decimate this program, since a large number
of faculty salaries and support staff salaries are paid from this program.
If they lose the faculty, they lose the trainees and the providers of the
services for children.  As I stated above, this is an extremely important
issue for me, as I will begin training at the Mailman Center in September.

PLEASE reconsider your veto. This grant impacts so many people in so many
ways. Not only will quality training programs be greatly affected, but also
think of how this will impact the children and families who come to the
Mailman Center for quality care and support.


Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Suzanne Braniecki, MA

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I believed that Chief Knight has the best interest of the patrol in his mind. Chief Knight has been actively involved in ensuring the mission of the patrol has not been lost and I believed that he will help the patrol push forward and regain our prestige that patrol has seem to lost. The members moral has suffered over the past several years mainly in part due to the pay issues that have the 12 year trooper making the same salary as the 1st year troopers out the academy. I believed that Chief Knight is well aware of these issues along with several others and will strive to repair the moral of troopers and supervisors alike.

Subject: Legislative Budget Appropriation - Specific Appropriation 1748
Winson Water Plant/North Miami Gravity Sewer System


Dear Jeb:

I want to thank you for the warm reception that I received at the Majority
Dinner last weekend in Orlando.  Your direct efforts to recognize my
community have been greatly appreciated.  I look forward to working with you
in the future.

Once again I need your help.  The City of North Miami has received two
appropriations that will assist us in improving the water and sewer
infrastructure for the Northeast Miami-Dade region.  The Legislature,
through Specific Appropriation # 1748, has appropriated $200,000 for the
Winson Water Plant Emergency Generator System and $400,000 for improvements
to the City's gravity sewer system.

Approval of these requests are vital, not only for the City, but for the
North Miami-Dade region as well.  The City's Water and Sewer System provides
service to close to 100,000 residents and businesses located in the City of
North Miami, the Villages of Miami Shores and Biscayne Park and a
substantial area of unincorporated Miami-Dade County.

The approval of the Winson Water Plant appropriation of $200,000 will ensure
that the City will be able to provide water service to its customers during
and after periods of power outages, such as during hurricanes and other
natural disasters.  The provision of this essential commodity is essential
to any sustained recovery after a natural disaster.

Likewise, the approval of the appropriation for the improvement of the
City's gravity sewer will aid in the elimination of infiltration of
stormwater into the sewer systems.  The unnecessary treatment of stormwater
transmitted by the sewer system to the County's POTW wastes valuable
treatment capacity and incurs unnecessary and high expenses for the
customers of the utility.  The reduction of stormwater from the County's
POTW will increase plant capacity that in turn will allow for further infill
development opportunities in the region.

Both of these improvements are vital to the delivery of services in our
region.  I urge you to join with me, as a fellow Republican, in supporting
the Legislature in the funding of these improvements.  Together, the City of
North Miami and the State of Florida will set the example of partnership in
the provision of regional services and the promotion of sustainable
communities.

Warmest Personal Regards, 

Joe Celestin
Mayor
City of North Miami

Governor Bush, 

The Mailman Center is at the cutting edge of the provision of services to children with developmental disabilities. My internship in Clinical Psychology at the Mailman Center was the most valuable training experience I received in terms of further career opportunities. Mailman truly has a nationwide reputation for excellence. In addition to changing the lives of countless individual children, the research provided by the Mailman Center is a phenomenal contribution to the fields of genetics, medicine, psychology, and other related disciplines. At Mailman, the faculty have developed innovate models of multi-disciplinary training and service integration. Without the ability to train professionals in the field of developmental disabilities, the high-quality care for children in Florida, and around the country will reach an abrupt end. I urge you to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from consideration for a veto.

Governor Bush, 

The Mailman Center is at the cutting edge of the provision of services to children with developmental disabilities. My internship in Clinical Psychology at the Mailman Center was the most valuable training experience I received in terms of further career opportunities. Mailman truly has a nationwide reputation for excellence. In addition to changing the lives of countless individual children, the research provided by the Mailman Center is a phenomenal contribution to the fields of genetics, medicine, psychology, and other related disciplines. At Mailman, the faculty have developed innovate models of multi-disciplinary training and service integration. Without the ability to train professionals in the field of developmental disabilities, the high-quality care for children in Florida, and around the country will reach an abrupt end. I urge you to withdraw the Mailman Center appropriation from consideration for a veto.

Governor,

You have asked each of us to give you a yes or no call on bills and budget
items.

On HB 1053, my recommendation is that you sign the bill.  While it is quite
long, to my knowledge their is only one section (#6) that was not included
in
the bill during the Committee review process.  All other sections were
either
in the original committee drafts, were amendments that were added in
committee,
or were other bills added that had been heard in committee (e.g. road
designations).

The bill contains nearly everything the Department asked for, including
additional right-of-way and bridge bonding capacity, our re-org package
(including the Turnpike Enterprise), delegation authority to local
government
to streamline permitting, employee bidding and many technical modifications.

Jeb, 
As I celebrated one of the happiest days in my life, that of the graduation of my daughter, our first child, from high school, I was also met with the news that my joy may not be experienced or shared by countless other parents of children here in Miami.  While I was blessed with an almost perfect child, and I mean this sincerely- she has a learning disability.  I was able to seek and find assistance for her.  If the funding to the Mailman Center is cut, many future graduates will not have the same opportunity as my daughter.  Our children will suffer and parents will be deprived of the many graduations that occur all through a child's life.
With the proper identification and necessary assistance dealing with the developmental problems of our children, we as parents can still cling to our hope of achievement for our children.  Our children will be capable of reaching their highest goals  and society will benefit from a engaged and productive citizen.  
Please reconsider you proposed funding cutting which will adversely affect the services being offered by the Mailman Center for Child Development.  Thank you

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, 
      I am writing to ask your assistance with a very urgent situation.  We 
learned late yesterday evening that the state funding, passed by the Florida 
House and Senate, has been targeted for veto.  This appropriation has been in 
place to match the funds from our MCHB LEND grant and the ADD UAP grant, and 
forms the foundation for all the training, service, and research programs.  
If this is lost, it will severely impact our program, and it is possible that 
we may not be able to operate.  This grant, administered in the form of a 
contract with Children’s Medical Services (CMS) of Florida, allows us to (1) 
provide training to CMS nurses and social workers statewide on issues related 
to developmental disabilities and children with special health care needs; 
(2) train more than 70 advanced graduate and post-graduate students in 
clinical and leadership skills each year, and (3) concurrent with the 
training program, provide clinical services in psychology, social work, 
nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, 
pediatrics, dentistry, and education to more than 13,000 children with 
developmental disabilities (e.g., mental retardation, autism, muscular 
dystrophy, Craniofacial anomalies) and serious childhood illnesses (e.g. 
cancer, sickle cell disease, diabetes, HIV, asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.).  
This represents approximately 1/3 of the children in Florida who have these 
illnesses or disabilities.  

Loss of this grant will likely decimate this program, since a large number of 
our faculty salaries and support staff salaries are paid from this program.  
If we lose the faculty, we lose the trainees and we lose the providers of the 
services for children.  As you can see, this is a complicated issue, and one 
of major importance.

Dear Governor Bush,

	I am the Director of Governmental Relations here at the University
of Miami School of Medicine.  I am writing you today to urge you not to veto
the appropriations for the Mailman Center for Child Development at the
University of Miami and Children's Medical Services (entitled "Florida
Family-Centered Intervention and Management Program") that has been in place
for more than 15 years.

	The Mailman Center contract provides funds that are used to leverage
a number of Federal grants from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the
Administration for Developmental Disabilities. Elimination of this line item
will severely compromise this continued designation and funding from the
Federal government, as well as the infrastructure for a multitude of other
programs based at the Center.  A veto will also compromise our ability to
sustain more than $11million of other local, state, and federally supported
programs that directly benefit the State since we leverage other funds that
come to Florida from the Federal government and private foundations. Our
existing infrastructure, supported by current state funds, permits rapid
response to new funding opportunities.  The combination of these funds
permits us to:

*	Train more than 120 multidisciplinary trainees in the area of
children with special health care needs and developmental disabilities, and
train more than 350 Children's Medical Services staff.
*	Provide continuing education to more than 7000 community
professionals and more than 3000 episodes of technical assistance to local,
state, and federal agencies.
*	Provide state-of-the-art clinical services to13,000 children
(largely poor and minority) at the Mailman Center and an additional 9,000
through affiliated programs ( totaling nearly 30% of children with special
health care needs in Florida).
*	Integrate functions (training, clinical service, technical
assistance) thereby reducing state expenditures for continuing education for

What is the Mailman Center?

*	The Mailman Center is an interdisciplinary academic division of the
Department of Pediatrics at the University of Miami School of Medicine.  We
employ more than 75 faculty from 14 discipline areas and 180 staff to
provide training, clinical service delivery, and research activities related
to child development, children with special health care needs, and
individuals with developmental disabilities.  Disciplines represented
include pediatrics, pediatric psychology, early childhood and special
education, social work, nutrition, audiology, speech and language pathology,
nursing, genetics, information systems, health administration, pediatric
dentistry, physical therapy, occupational therapy.  We also work in close
affiliation with the programs of the Holtz Maternal and Child Health Center
at Jackson Memorial Hospital.  Using the State contract and leveraged
funding from other federal and local sources described below, these faculty
provide the following:

o	Training.  More than 110 graduate and post-graduate students in the
discipline fields above receive on-site (1 to 12-months, part-time or
full-time), specialized, interdisciplinary clinical training at the Mailman
Center each year.

o	Clinical Service Delivery.  Clinical services are provided to
children with special health care needs and developmental disabilities by
faculty and by students under direct faculty supervision.  Closely
coordinated with Jackson Children's Hospital, many of these services
provided by trainees are non-reimbursed, and unavailable by other means,
allowing us to enhance health care access while simultaneously training the
next generation of professionals. This clinical approach specifically
attempts to reduce disparity in health outcome for vulnerable children.
More than 13,000 children receive clinical services at the Mailman Center
and affiliated programs each year, the vast majority of whom are indigent or
receive State/Federal health insurance coverage.  Most of these children
represent minority populations who are diverse in culture and language,
requiring specialized skills for service delivery.  These include children
with developmental disabilities and delays (e.g., autism, mental
retardation, congenital genetic disorders), chronic illnesses (cancer,
sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, asthma), and environmentally
disabling conditions (e.g., child abuse and neglect, exposure to domestic
violence, involvement in juvenile courts).

o	Community Outreach and Technical Assistance.  Continuing education
is provided by Mailman Center faculty to more than 8,700 professionals in
Florida each year, and more than 625 hours of technical assistance is
provided to agencies by Mailman Center faculty each year.  One specific
benefit of the State appropriation for the Mailman Center is continuing
education training that addresses specific needs of the 350+ CMS employed
nurse care coordinators and social workers.  We are now developing
internet-based training for these CMS staff that is targeted to identified
needs, with the first courses to go on-line this Spring.  This will result
in a substantial cost savings for CMS, since travel costs and time away from
work to gain continuing education will be essentially eliminated. (Estimated
Savings to the State: $210,000 of currently expended dollars).

o	 Research.  Faculty at the Mailman Center are engaged in
state-of-the art research on child development, improved diagnosis and
treatment, and public policy.  More than $4 M of federal and foundation
support is obtained by Mailman Center faculty for research each year.  The
State appropriation for the Mailman Center permits faculty to include
trainees in these research activities, contributing to continued development
of cutting-edge research in the future.  We also work with other State and
Federal agencies and programs (e.g., HCFA, AHCA, Social Security
Administration, the Developmental Disabilities Council) to respond to RFAs
that are potentially beneficial to Florida.

o	Advocacy.  The Mailman Center Advocacy program works to identify
areas of need for children with special health care needs and works with
legislators to develop model legislation/programs to address these needs.
One example of this is the Statewide Newborn Hearing Screening Program
established by the 2000 Legislature.  In addition, the Mailman Center is a
resource for Florida legislators for information related to emerging topics
related to health care, developmental disabilities, and children with
special health care needs.

*	The Mailman Center is Florida's University Center for Excellence in
Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service.  This is the new
title designated under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of
Rights Act of 2000, known as the "DD Act".  The Mailman Center has served
this function for Florida since 1972 (formerly known as the University
Affiliated Facility (UAF) and, more recently, the University Affiliated
Program (UAP).

*	The Mailman Center is the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental
Disabilities (LEND) Center for Florida, funded for more than 35 years by the
Maternal Child Health Bureau to provide interdisciplinary training related
to neurodevelopmental disabilities and children with special health care
needs at the pre-doctoral and post-doctoral levels.  This is the only HRSA
funded training program in Florida.

*	The Mailman Center has created an infrastructure that supports a
number of major state programs, including the University of Miami Child
Protection Team, the Mailman Center Early Intervention Program (EIP), and
operates clinics for Children's Medical Services (CMS) programs in
Adolescent Medicine, Asthma, Cleft Lip and Palate, Gasteroenterology, and
Endocrinology.  We are also closely affiliated with the Florida
Developmental Disabilities Council, the Florida Family Care Council, and the
Protection and Advocacy Center.

*	The Mailman Center has developed multiple affiliation agreements
with other state universities across Florida.  We have recently developed a
subcontract with Florida International University that includes FIU faculty
in occupational therapy and physical therapy as part of the teaching faculty
of the Mailman Center LEND program.  Formal training agreements allow
students from a number of Florida universities to receive advanced training
in the Mailman Center program, including those from FIU, University of
Florida, Florida State University, and the University of South Florida.

*	The Mailman Center has formal contracts and inter-agency
affiliations with many local agencies supported by the State, including the
Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami-Dade County Public School System, the
Head-Start and Early Head-Start programs, the Juvenile Justice System,
Miami-Dade and Miami Police Departments, and multiple agencies responsible
for service delivery to children with developmental disabilities and special
health care needs, including United Cerebral Palsy, Association for Retarded
Citizens, Parent-to-Parent, and the Bertha Abyss Center.

Dear Governor Bush,

	I am the Director of Governmental Relations here at the University
of Miami School of Medicine.  I am writing you today to urge you not to veto
the appropriations for the Mailman Center for Child Development at the
University of Miami and Children's Medical Services (entitled "Florida
Family-Centered Intervention and Management Program") that has been in place
for more than 15 years.

	The Mailman Center contract provides funds that are used to leverage
a number of Federal grants from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the
Administration for Developmental Disabilities. Elimination of this line item
will severely compromise this continued designation and funding from the
Federal government, as well as the infrastructure for a multitude of other
programs based at the Center.  A veto will also compromise our ability to
sustain more than $11million of other local, state, and federally supported
programs that directly benefit the State since we leverage other funds that
come to Florida from the Federal government and private foundations. Our
existing infrastructure, supported by current state funds, permits rapid
response to new funding opportunities.  The combination of these funds
permits us to:

*	Train more than 120 multidisciplinary trainees in the area of
children with special health care needs and developmental disabilities, and
train more than 350 Children's Medical Services staff.
*	Provide continuing education to more than 7000 community
professionals and more than 3000 episodes of technical assistance to local,
state, and federal agencies.
*	Provide state-of-the-art clinical services to13,000 children
(largely poor and minority) at the Mailman Center and an additional 9,000
through affiliated programs ( totaling nearly 30% of children with special
health care needs in Florida).
*	Integrate functions (training, clinical service, technical
assistance) thereby reducing state expenditures for continuing education for
state staff and direct service costs provided by trainees, resulting in a
cost savings for Florida.
*	Work closely in partnership with a large number of community and
State agencies, universities, and organizations to jointly accomplish shared
objectives.

	Performance of this contract has been reviewed annually by CMS and
found to be in full compliance.  I believe that you will find that the
Mailman Center contract meets and exceeds all the expectations for continued
funding that you specified earlier this year. The Mailman Center uses the
State appropriation it has received for many years to provide the

Governor Bush:  

I understand that you plan to veto the state funding for the Mailman Center,
which was passed by the Florida House and Senate.  If this funding is lost,
it will severely impact that vital program, and it is possible that it will
cease to exist.  The Mailman Center is one of only a handful of UAP sites,
and as such it (1) provides training to CMS nurses and social workers
statewide on issues related to developmental disabilities and children with
special health care needs; (2) trains more than 70 advanced graduate and
post-graduate students in clinical and leadership skills each year, and (3)
concurrent with the training program, provides clinical services in
psychology, social work, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy,
speech and language therapy, pediatrics, dentistry, and education to more
than 13,000 children with developmental disabilities (e.g., mental
retardation, autism, muscular dystrophy, Craniofacial anomalies) and serious
childhood illnesses (e.g. cancer, sickle cell disease, diabetes, HIV,
asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.).  This census represents approximately 1/3 of
the children in Florida who have these illnesses or disabilities.  

I am a former trainee of the Mailman Center, and my experience there had a
profound effect on the course of my career development.  Most certainly, if
it were not for my training experiences, I would not be in the position I am
today.  In my current role, I participate on (and in some cases lead)
multi-disciplinary teams serving children with chronic medical illness,
including various cancers, genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and
developmental disabilities.  In addition to providing me with outstanding
clinical skills (that have been remarked upon by all subsequent supervisors
and colleagues), my experience at the Mailman Center afforded me the
opportunity to develop leadership skills that are critical in setting up and
coordinating programs to serve medically needy children.  It also taught me
the process of completing clinical research in a major medical setting - an
activity which is of paramount importance in fostering treatment efforts.
My time at Mailman was extraordinary, from both a professional and personal
perspective, and I am saddened and outraged by turns that such a magnificent
institution would be denied funding to continue its service to the children
of south Florida.  Please reconsider your choice to deprive medically ill
children of much needed care.

Dear Mr. Bush: 

I am writing out of deep concern that the State funding which supports the 
Mailman Center for Child Development is slated to be cut from the budget -- I 
urge to you reconsider. 

I recently completed my 5th year as a doctoral student in Pediatric Health 
Clinical Psychology at the University of Miami, and will be interning at the 
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the next year.  I am originally 
from Seattle, Washington, and choose to relocate 3,000 miles from what I then 
considered to be "home" simply because of the OUTSTANDING Pediatric 
Psychology training available at the University of Miami and the Mailman 
Center for Child Development.  The training provided at the Mailman Center is 
second to none. As a practicum student and as a research assistant, I was 
afforded the unique opportunity to gain extensive experience working within 
interdisciplinary medical environments;  I worked with and served a richly 
diverse clientele; I learned to appreciate the importance of providing 
quality care to all families -- regardless of race and socioeconomic status 
-- I realized that training at the Mailman Center provided a unique 
opportunity to incorporate outstanding clinical service with exceptional 
interdisciplinary research and training -- how fortunate I was. 

I recently applied for my clinical internship placement -- a final 
requirement of my doctoral program.  Meeting fellow students and interviewing 
at programs throughout the country allowed me to fully realize the 
OUTSTANDING quality of the training available at the Mailman Center.  My 
experiences working with children with HIV Infection, Cancer, Sickle Cell 
Disease and other chronic illnesses were unmatched, both in breadth and in 
quality -- my knowledge and experience working within interdisciplinary 
medical environments were significantly more advanced than that of the 
majority of my colleagues -- how luck I felt to have trained at the Mailman 
Center.  How proud I felt to have served and trained in one of the top 
centers for child development in the country.  How lucky I was that the 
individuals who govern Florida care deeply for the children living in the 
State . . . how sad and concerned I feel now that funding for such an amazing 
training and care facility could be cut. 

Mr. Bush, I urge you to continue to fund the Mailman Center for Child 
Development. Please continue to support our young children's development -- 
please, VETO the planned budget cut for the Mailman Center for Child 
Development. 

Thank you,

Governor,

I am aware that there has been discussion regarding vetoing the proviso
language in Line 1235 relating to CINS/FINS mental health and substance
abuse services.  This is critical funding that we currently have and need to
deal with some of the highest risk youth that come into our shelters around
the state from the street.  I believe this item does stand up to any test
regarding targeting the youth most likely to enter the JJ system and it was
processed as a member project sponsored by Senator Carlton and
Representative Fasano.  I spoke with Brad Thomas and gave him my best shot.
Thanks for your consideration.

Secondly, I understand that DCF is doing a briefing for you that includes
CBC on Monday.  The department did invite me once to one of these some time
ago, but no longer.  I wanted you to be aware that while there is movement
and CBC is showing real signs of progress, we still have a stumbling block
with the data system, HomeSafeNet.  The problem is that the department has
taken the position that they must dictate to the CBC agencies how data is
entered into the system (i.e. no electronic transfer from our local system
into HSN, case managers must do the data entry, etc.), we are asking for
flexibility as to how we populate the required fields.  Also, the department
has developed an elaborate "best practices" model that literally dictates
the methodology of delivering services and controls the decision making.
CBC is absolutely and fundamentally established to allow and encourage local
designs and decision making.  These issues can be negotiated, but thus far
the department has been unwilling to compromise in the least.  It is not an

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
Tallahassee, Florida

Dear Mr. Governor:

I am writing you today on behalf of budget item 145A, Project SYSTEM (SER,
Youth Co-Op, SABER, Training, Education & Motivation).

Project SYSTEM integrates 80 years combined experience of South Florida's
three largest non-profit youth education organizations into a seamless
SYSTEM of services for at-risk youth, i.e. potential and actual dropouts.

These organizations have successfully operated similar programs for the
Florida Department of Education for many years.  The project was reviewed
and recommended by the Department of Education.

The project's specific measurable objectives include the enrollment of over
900 at-risk youth, retention of 90% of them and a placement rate of 70%.

Mr. Governor, as you well know from your personal visit to the SER training
center in Ft. Lauderdale, these programs are in heavy demand and are
operated professionally and are fiscally-sound.

Thank you.

By vetoing this item in your budget, you will set back a cure for diabetes a long way.  The DRI in Miami is very close to finding a cure for diabetes through their research on the Islet Cell Transplant program.  I want you to know you are making a big mistake.  The State of Florida will become internationally known when the DRI comes up with a cure.
 
You will lose my vote of you veto this item in the Budget.  Please reconsider!

Dear Governor Bush;

We need your help!  Please do not veto the Mailman Center appropriation from
the budget.  These funds will directly impact the service delivery for many
children and their families with developmental disabilities and special
health care needs.  These dollars reflect the current needs of the system by
enhancing service delivery with:
1.	providing training to nurses and social workers in the field on
issues relating to developmental disabilities and children with special
needs.
2.	trains and educates graduate students in family-centered and
cultural competencies with this fragile population; and 
3.	provides direct services (occupational, physical, and speech
therapies...just to mention a few) to over 13,000 children with
disabilities.

As you can see...this program is valuable!  And needed to assist the
community in providing the much needed services in a manner sensitive to
families.

Please hold the pen on this one....

Thank you for your continued support!

Subject:	Mailman Center VETO

Dear Mr. Bush: 

I am writing out of deep concern that the State funding which supports the 
Mailman Center for Child Development is slated to be cut from the budget -- I 
urge to you reconsider. 

I recently completed my 5th year as a doctoral student in Pediatric Health 
Clinical Psychology at the University of Miami, and will be interning at the 
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the next year.  I am originally 
from Seattle, Washington, and choose to relocate 3,000 miles from what I then 
considered to be "home" simply because of the OUTSTANDING Pediatric 
Psychology training available at the University of Miami and the Mailman 
Center for Child Development.  The training provided at the Mailman Center is 
second to none. As a practicum student and as a research assistant, I was 
afforded the unique opportunity to gain extensive experience working within 
interdisciplinary medical environments;  I worked with and served a richly 
diverse clientele; I learned to appreciate the importance of providing 
quality care to all families -- regardless of race and socioeconomic status 
-- I realized that training at the Mailman Center provided a unique 
opportunity to incorporate outstanding clinical service with exceptional 
interdisciplinary research and training -- how fortunate I was. 

I recently applied for my clinical internship placement -- a final 
requirement of my doctoral program.  Meeting fellow students and interviewing 
at programs throughout the country allowed me to fully realize the 
OUTSTANDING quality of the training available at the Mailman Center.  My 
experiences working with children with HIV Infection, Cancer, Sickle Cell 
Disease and other chronic illnesses were unmatched, both in breadth and in 
quality -- my knowledge and experience working within interdisciplinary 
medical environments were significantly more advanced than that of the 
majority of my colleagues -- how luck I felt to have trained at the Mailman 
Center.  How proud I felt to have served and trained in one of the top 
centers for child development in the country.  How lucky I was that the 
individuals who govern Florida care deeply for the children living in the 
State . . . how sad and concerned I feel now that funding for such an amazing 
training and care facility could be cut. 

Mr. Bush, I urge you to continue to fund the Mailman Center for Child 
Development. Please continue to support our young children's development -- 
please, VETO the planned budget cut for the Mailman Center for Child 
Development. 

Thank you,

Governor Bush:  

I understand that you plan to veto the state funding for the Mailman Center,
which was passed by the Florida House and Senate.  If this funding is lost,
it will severely impact that vital program, and it is possible that it will
cease to exist.  The Mailman Center is one of only a handful of UAP sites,
and as such it (1) provides training to CMS nurses and social workers
statewide on issues related to developmental disabilities and children with
special health care needs; (2) trains more than 70 advanced graduate and
post-graduate students in clinical and leadership skills each year, and (3)
concurrent with the training program, provides clinical services in
psychology, social work, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy,
speech and language therapy, pediatrics, dentistry, and education to more
than 13,000 children with developmental disabilities (e.g., mental
retardation, autism, muscular dystrophy, Craniofacial anomalies) and serious
childhood illnesses (e.g. cancer, sickle cell disease, diabetes, HIV,
asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.).  This census represents approximately 1/3 of
the children in Florida who have these illnesses or disabilities.  

I am a former trainee of the Mailman Center, and my experience there had a
profound effect on the course of my career development.  Most certainly, if
it were not for my training experiences, I would not be in the position I am
today.  In my current role, I participate on (and in some cases lead)
multi-disciplinary teams serving children with chronic medical illness,
including various cancers, genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and
developmental disabilities.  In addition to providing me with outstanding
clinical skills (that have been remarked upon by all subsequent supervisors
and colleagues), my experience at the Mailman Center afforded me the
opportunity to develop leadership skills that are critical in setting up and
coordinating programs to serve medically needy children.  It also taught me
the process of completing clinical research in a major medical setting - an
activity which is of paramount importance in fostering treatment efforts.
My time at Mailman was extraordinary, from both a professional and personal
perspective, and I am saddened and outraged by turns that such a magnificent
institution would be denied funding to continue its service to the children
of south Florida.  Please reconsider your choice to deprive medically ill
children of much needed care.

Governor,

After reading the article in the Sarasota paper this morning, I wanted to take the opportunity to share some information with you that I have shared with staff.  The IG report cited in the article was based on only a percentage of the ITVM’s in the market, and in fact did not include the 278 machines located in Winn Dixie stores, which alone produced $18 Million in incremental sales increases for the Lottery.
The ITVM program has cost the State $6.8 million over 4 years and generated $86,000,000 and provided $32,000,000 for the Education Trust Fund.
We have been willing to work with the Lottery on relocating the machines that have not been living up to their fullest potential and feel that the language provided in the proviso allows all parties the opportunity to develop the best program for the State of Florida.
Thank you for your attention.  If we can provide you with any additional information, please feel free to contact me.
Take Care,

Governor, 
Please don't veto funding for the Mailman Center.
This would be tragic, and inconsistent with much of the good work you have 
advocated in social services and education.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am an Assistant Professor of Clinical Pediatrics in the Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami School of Medicine.  I am also a Rebublican, and past supporter of your campaign for Governor, as well as a supporter of your brother's candidacy for President.  I was pleased when you announced recently that you would run for Governor again, and I had intended again to support that campaign.  
 
This afternoon, however, I was stunned to discover that you apparently intended to veto funding for the Mailman Center for Child Development here at the University of Miami.  As you must know, the Mailman Center has a national reputation for excellence in the training of a variety child healthcare professionals.  More importantly, the staff and trainees of the Mailman Center provide direct clinical services to more than 10,000 (many more, I believe) Florida children with developmental disabilities.  I am informed that the loss of these matching funds will, for all intents and purposes, destroy the Mailman Center and result in the termination of these essentials services to these children and their families.  
 
Even in times of difficult fiscal decisions, this action would, in point of fact, be fiscally imprudent.  It would be a classic example of penny wise, pound foulish.  Early interventions in the lives of developmentally disabled children results in a long-term savings to the State of Florida by increasing these citizens productivity and decreasing the need for future support as they become adults.
 
Finally, I am dismayed to see your office giving our political opponents such a powerful weapon against your candidacy.  The picture of our Governor slamming the door on a disabled child in a wheelchair, is not a picture I care to see in ads during what is surely to be a bitter campaign.
 
I continue to hope that this is some kind of an oversight by your staff.   Hoping to be able to continue to support the fine work you have done for Florida, I remain,
 
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
Please veto the bad  billboard bill - HB 1053".

 <http://www.geocities.com/legalizard/summer2001.html> Reasons to veto the bill:
First, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad public policy:
         1. HB 1053 creates special property rights for billboards not enjoyed by other personal property.
         2. HB 1053 overturns years of decisions and planning by local governments
         3. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of "carve-outs" for some politically powerful areas.
        4. HB 1053 is essentially an unfunded mandate that will increase the cost of local government.
        5. HB 1053 is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic beauty.
 
Second, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is contrary to the Fundamental Principles of the Republican Party:
        1. The Republican Party believes in equal rights, equal justice and equal opportunity for all:
                a. HB 1053 creates a new extra privilege for billboards not available to other types of personal property. 
                b. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of the "carve-outs" that were created for communities with powerful legislators.
         2. The Republican Party believes the most effective, responsible and responsive government is government closest to the people.  HB 1053 overturns local decisions and substitutes "big government" mandates.

Third, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad politics:
        1. HB 1053's billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida which include:
                a. The Florida League of Cities
                b. The Florida Association of Counties
                 c. The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs
                d. 1000 Friends of Florida
                e. American Planning Association Florida Chapter
                f. Citizens for a Scenic Florida
                g. Florida League of Conservation Voters and
                 h. Over 20 major newspapers in Florida
        2. HB 1053 serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too many inappropriately placed billboards.
        3. HB 1053 is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.  After all, the ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected councils and commissions.
        4. HB 1053 is inconsistent with Gov. Bush's previous support for decisions being made by local government.

Governor,

After reading the article in the Sarasota paper this morning, I wanted to take the opportunity to share some information with you that I have shared with staff.  The IG report cited in the article was based on only a percentage of the ITVM’s in the market, and in fact did not include the 278 machines located in Winn Dixie stores, which alone produced $18 Million in incremental sales increases for the Lottery.
The ITVM program has cost the State $6.8 million over 4 years and generated $86,000,000 and provided $32,000,000 for the Education Trust Fund.
We have been willing to work with the Lottery on relocating the machines that have not been living up to their fullest potential and feel that the language provided in the proviso allows all parties the opportunity to develop the best program for the State of Florida.
Thank you for your attention.  If we can provide you with any additional information, please feel free to contact me.
Take Care,

I am rather confused because the individuals who would be moving into these group homes wrote you letters about their prospective new homes.

It is my understanding that this juvenile program has tentatively been 
approved in the legislature for funding in the amount of $235,000.  I 
also understand that it may be subject to the "axe" at this time.
This program, the St. Lucie County Sheriff's After School Misdemeanor 
Diversion Program for juvenile offenders serves, not only St. Lucie 
Counties, but surrounding counties including Martin County.  A review 
of the success record of this program will affirm the worthiness of 
continuing, if not increasing, funding.
I urge you to remind the Governor of the merit and value of this 
program, and to allow this program to receive the tentatively approved 
funding.  We are making great headway in reducing juvenile crime in 
Florida, but we must not reduce the efforts in our treatment programs 
NOR our PREVENTION programs.

I strongly commend and support the efforts of St. Lucie County Sheriff 
Ken Mascara and Ms. Christine Epps, director of this juvenile program.

Dear Pam

The following is background information about President Bono- Martinez for
Governor Bush's meeting on Friday.:

Mr. Bono Martinez is president ( the equivalent to Governor of the region)
of Castille- La Mancha. This is the region surrounding Madrid. Although it
does not include the Capital city. He is 50 years old and an attorney. 

He has been President of the region for 15 years and  is highly popular in
all Spain and considered a highly skilled, experienced and very powerful
political leader.

He is part of the Socialist Party of Spain, which is the opposition party.
Considered as left leaning in his politics but pro-business with good
relations with the private sector.

HOWEVER, he is not the leading candidate for next President of Spain. It is
very unlikely that he will be the candidate of the Socialist party since he
lost the election for Secretary General to a rival (Jose Rodriquez-
Zapatero) at the most recent party convention. The Secretary General of a
party in Spanish politics  becomes the anointed to become his party's
candidate. 

Hope this is useful.

I always encourage meetings with senior foreign dignitaries if they can be
accommodated.  It is good for Florida. Consul Rodriquez is a very capable
career service diplomat and very charming. Sincerely wants to bring Mexico
and Florida together. Mexico is very, very important growth market for us.
Also,If he has a letter from President Fox protocol requires him to try to
formally deliver it in person.

 On that note Ambassador Jacovella of Argentina is calling once again to see
if the Governor could possibly meet with him for even 15 minutes before the
trip to Argentina July 14-21. I had already regretted as instructed but but
he wants to know if it would be possible to scheduled between meetings
during one of the Governor's visit in South Florida. i hate to harp on this
but apparently he is getting pressure from senior levels of the Argentine
Government to try to meet and he kees calling.

Best regards,

Manny

Hi Tara,
	The Mexican Consul General, Ambassador Manuel Rodriguez, told me
that he would very much like to meet briefly with Governor Bush in
Tallahassee to present a letter from Mexican President Fox.  He also wants
to tell him that President Fox plans to visit Florida in early September
this year to attend the Miami Herald's Conference of the Americas. The visit
to Florida by a Mexican president would be unprecedented. I recommend that
the Governor receive Rodriguez in order to signal his continued interest in
developing further ties - including business -- between Florida and Mexico.

	We would attempt to arrange a separate meeting for Rodriguez with
Secretary Harris and of course be instrumental in facilitating President
Fox's visit to Florida.  I presume that the Herald has invited the Governor
to the Conference by now.  Hugh

This is in response to an email that circuitously made its way from you to your friend Maria to Governor Jeb Bush, who has asked me to respond. I apologize for the delay, but have seen firsthand that even e-mail can take its time getting to the right person!

Your email expressed your concerns regaridng the new Commission for Independent Education and the sunset of the State Board of Non-Public Career Education, and, more specifically, the status of its director Sam Ferguson. Sam has done an exemplary job in his role and has consistently put the needs of students in the forefront. 

The legislation implementing the new education governance structure calls for a merger of the State Board of NonPublic Career Education and the State Board of Independent Colleges and Universities and a transfer of the powers and duties of this merged group to the Division of Independent Education. This division will be administered by an executive director.

I appreciate your candor regarding the service of Sam Ferguson and will follow through on your request to make sure the Governor is aware of it as well.

I appreciate you taking the time to write and encourage you to stay informed and involved in education issues.

Governor:

To receive the news of a veto and be disappointed would be a gross
understatement.

If following the rules of the ----

     Legislative Process

     Board of Regents

     Postsecondary Education Commission

     MGT Implementation Study

meant anything at all there wouldn't be a need for this e-mail.

You say you are interested in minority access to education and lowering
health care costs ---  your veto will be inconsistent with that message.

You have until mid-night Saturday to change your mind.  For the sake of
Florida's brightest students that are forced to leave the state to
receive their education and the thousands of patients in Florida that
seek chiropractic care, I pray you look to yourself and not staff on
this issue.

Dear Governor Bush:

I strongly support Crisis Nursery Programs.  They are vital to the children

these very important programs, such as the Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis

Subject:	Funding for St. Lucie County Sheriff's After School Misdemeanor Diversion Program (Juvenile offenders)

It is my understanding that this juvenile program has tentatively been 
approved in the legislature for funding in the amount of $235,000.  I 
also understand that it may be subject to the "axe" at this time.
This program, the St. Lucie County Sheriff's After School Misdemeanor 
Diversion Program for juvenile offenders serves, not only St. Lucie 
Counties, but surrounding counties including Martin County.  A review 
of the success record of this program will affirm the worthiness of 
continuing, if not increasing, funding.
I urge you to remind the Governor of the merit and value of this 
program, and to allow this program to receive the tentatively approved 
funding.  We are making great headway in reducing juvenile crime in 
Florida, but we must not reduce the efforts in our treatment programs 
NOR our PREVENTION programs.

I strongly commend and support the efforts of St. Lucie County Sheriff 
Ken Mascara and Ms. Christine Epps, director of this juvenile program.  
Thank you

Dear Jeb...
You're doing a great job.  Thanks.
There is one point you might want to consider before cutting funding to the 
Hibiscus Children Center.  
What would happen if a child didn't have to be placed in safe child seat in 
cars before he/she was involved in a car crash?  Just doing it after the 
wreck is too late.

Why wear seatbelts?  Wait until you'd been exposed to an accident and then 
wear them?  Too late.

The Cirsis Center is preventative.  We'll never know how many lives are saved 
by wearing seat belts or using child restrain systems.  We really don't want 
to know.  The cirsis center stops child abuse before the parent is out of 
control.

Give it a thought before you sharpen your pencil.
See you in Indian River County in Oct. for the Republican fund raiser.
Thanks

Dear Governor,

I know it is about time for you to act upon the big Health Regulation
package (SB 1558) and that there are some provisions that like me you are
not thrilled with. However it does include many provisions that the Florida
Nurses Association considers very important. First and foremost is this bill
creates the Florida Center for Nursing that I have discussed with you in
several messages and meetings. It also contains many provisions that will
streamline procedures for licensing nurses moving into Florida from other
states and we also support the provision that requires the Board of Nursing
to move from Jacksonville to Tallahassee by July 1, 2003. I had not
contacted you about this bill because I had not heard until yesterday that
there is a possibility that you might veto it. I ask that you allow this
bill to become law.

Now I promise I will not sending any more requests regarding pending bills
on your desk!

I enjoyed seeing you at the dinner last weekend and I am extremely pleased
that the Bush-Brogan team will enjoy a second term!

Sincerely,

Subject:	Legislature

Dear Governor:

When the legislature is contemplating new laws for the State of Florida, where do members get most of their input from?  Is it from other legislators or from the public?  It seems that Florida's legislature passes numerous laws without input from the state's citizens.  I came to this conclusion after my wife and I viewed the statutes on several occassions to find new laws that took effect that we had not even heard about.  It appears that many of the laws are built upon existing laws; yet, those individuals and families that are most affected by these laws have no input.
I know I am being vague as I'm not citing any one example -- I endeavor to be discreet when writing from my work (Florida Philharmonic Orchestra) e-mail address, but it is the underlying principle of citizens being informed before major decisions are made.  What does it take for one to have the opportunity to formally address the legislature in person?  And, while you are basically inaccessible to the general public (for security and other reasons, I'm sure), what are the chances of my wife and I, or at least my wife, having the opportunity to meet you personally and address some issues as long as others are present so as to keep it ethical?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  God bless.

Dear Jeb:

I understand that Mr. Langston talked to Senator Carlton regarding several of Mote's
budget items.  I am sorry to keep bugging you, but want to make a last minute plea
to not veto the following.  The reasons we had several items in the budget this
year are:

1.   Four of them are one-time requests:  Keating, SeaTrek, Cultural Endowment and
     Sawfish.  We promise you that we will not be back with requests to the
     State on any of these items.  This is the second year we have waited for the
     Cultural Endowment match.

2.   JASON is an international program that we have brought to Florida students
     since 1989 with matching support from the State.  It has done a lot of good
     for science education, and we hate to see its continuity lost, affecting hundreds
     of teachers and thousands of students.

3.   The Aquaculture appropriation was recommended by the Aquaculture Review
     Council and is for the continuation of the program to its second year.  We
     would lose the investment we have made to date utilizing funds from both
     private sources and the State.  Moreover, the State will lose a significant
     economic development potential in aquaculture.

4.   The Sawfish program is a unique opportunity for Florida to provide timely input
     on the first true marine species that is close to extinction in the State of Florida
     where it used to be abundant.  Matching funds have been acquired from the
     National Geographic Society, National Marine Fisheries Service and the Disney
     Conservation Fund.

I know it is a tight budget year and you have tough decisions to make.  However, for
the reasons I have stated, these budget items are important investments for the State
of Florida that fuel economic development and significantly improve the science
education of our students.  Also, as you know, all of our programs provide benefits
for multiple counties and statewide.  Thanks again for your consideration.

Kumar

I can tell you that this will receive bad press as a perk for "rich

of Hillsborough county, but otherwise never needed it.  It is a privately 
owned airport and I think that the majority of citizens will see this as a

     economic development potential in aquaculture.

4.   The Sawfish program is a unique opportunity for Florida to provide timely input
     on the first true marine species that is close to extinction in the State of Florida
     where it used to be abundant.  Matching funds have been acquired from the
     National Geographic Society, National Marine Fisheries Service and the Disney
     Conservation Fund.

I know it is a tight budget year and you have tough decisions to make.  However, for
the reasons I have stated, these budget items are important investments for the State
of Florida that fuel economic development and significantly improve the science
education of our students.  Also, as you know, all of our programs provide benefits
for multiple counties and statewide.  Thanks again for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush, 

Please do not veto budget item #577A in the state budget which is for the
$500K Islet Cell Transplantation program at the DIABETES RESEARCH INSTITUTE
(DRI) FOUNDATION.  The sponsors of the Bill are Senator Ron Silver (D) and
Representative Manny Priegues (R).  This money is CRITICAL to helping us
find a cure to diabetes which affects millions of Americas.  It has taken
the life of my mother and my brother and father have to live with this
terrible disease every day.  I want to find a cure for them which is why I
have supported the DRI for the past four years through funding and
volunteering.

Jeb,
 
I am incredibly dismayed and disappointed at the message that I got today from Mike Hansen, that you are going to veto the FSU Chiropractic College appropriation.  According to Mike, your concern is that the original dollars ($83 million) will still be needed even though the chiropractic school will be part of the Panama City campus, as a joint use facility.  The original numbers, coming from the MGT study, were for the purchase of land and construction of a new facility for classrooms, labs, libraries and administrative offices for educating up to 500 students.  FSU did its own study, at your request, and their estimate was $20 million for upgrading and adding buildings that would be used for the chiropractic school and other programs on the Panama City campus.  
 
I don't know what other information to give you.  A study was done, commissioned by the legislature, showing the needs as well as the costs of this program.  An update cost analysis was done by FSU, showing the true costs.  An underutilized campus will be brought to life with new students and programs, new dollars from grant programs will be flowing to FSU and the economic impact of this school will be felt by the Panama City community.  
 
My 5000+ colleagues  and their patients will be truly upset and disappointed with your decision, Jeb.  My Hispanic and African American friends, who were excited about the possibility of a public chiropractic school that their children could now afford and attend, will also be disappointed. Most importantly, Jeb, I am disappointed in you.  You call this a policy decision, but what was the medical school? Every Florida medical  school, as well as the Board of Regents, opposed this measure last year.  The total dollars needed for capital outlay continues to rise. You yourself stated that total costs were still up in the air.  There was no study done, or analysis that showed a true need for a new school.  Any yet, you consider your decision  "good policy"?
 
You still are my Governor, and I  respect you and  support you. But this decision is hypocritical at best. And I've never known you to be hypocritical. It's not your style. That is why your current position is so disappointing to me.  
 
Respectfully,

Subject: Legislative Budget Appropriation - Specific Appropriation 1748
Winson Water Plant/North Miami Gravity Sewer System


Dear Jeb:

I want to thank you for the warm reception that I received at the Majority
Dinner last weekend in Orlando.  Your direct efforts to recognize my
community have been greatly appreciated.  I look forward to working with you
in the future.

Once again I need your help.  The City of North Miami has received two
appropriations that will assist us in improving the water and sewer
infrastructure for the Northeast Miami-Dade region.  The Legislature,
through Specific Appropriation # 1748, has appropriated $200,000 for the
Winson Water Plant Emergency Generator System and $400,000 for improvements
to the City's gravity sewer system.

Approval of these requests are vital, not only for the City, but for the
North Miami-Dade region as well.  The City's Water and Sewer System provides
service to close to 100,000 residents and businesses located in the City of
North Miami, the Villages of Miami Shores and Biscayne Park and a
substantial area of unincorporated Miami-Dade County.

The approval of the Winson Water Plant appropriation of $200,000 will ensure
that the City will be able to provide water service to its customers during
and after periods of power outages, such as during hurricanes and other
natural disasters.  The provision of this essential commodity is essential
to any sustained recovery after a natural disaster.

Likewise, the approval of the appropriation for the improvement of the
City's gravity sewer will aid in the elimination of infiltration of
stormwater into the sewer systems.  The unnecessary treatment of stormwater
transmitted by the sewer system to the County's POTW wastes valuable
treatment capacity and incurs unnecessary and high expenses for the
customers of the utility.  The reduction of stormwater from the County's
POTW will increase plant capacity that in turn will allow for further infill
development opportunities in the region.

Both of these improvements are vital to the delivery of services in our
region.  I urge you to join with me, as a fellow Republican, in supporting
the Legislature in the funding of these improvements.  Together, the City of
North Miami and the State of Florida will set the example of partnership in
the provision of regional services and the promotion of sustainable
communities.

Warmest Personal Regards, 

Joe Celestin
Mayor
City of North Miami

Dear Governor Bush:
Please accept this a very strong expression of support for General Revenue,
Specific Appropriation 194 Harbor Beanch Marine Science - FAU $950,000.
These funds are for the funding a full year of the "Semester by the Sea"
marine science program.  Demand for the pilot of this program was far
greater than expected, and based on the pilot program, it is expected that
baccalaureate, masters and doctorial students and research scientists from
around the world will attend.  This is an opportunity for Florida to promote
worldwide its natural treasures and the Indian River Lagoon, and to
eventually attract commerce related to these industries.
As President of the St. Lucie County Chamber of Commerce and local attorney,
I urge your support of this program.  It has much to offer the State of
Florida and the region.
Respectfully yours,

The Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor 
State of Florida 
jeb@jeb.org 

Dear Governor Bush: 

I just heard there might be a problem with budget item #1748, my #1 priority in the budget.  I had assumed it was okay since it is a continuation of funding that passed the Water Advisory Panel last year.  I can't reach Kimberly Dale so I thought I would contact you directly.

The appropriation requested for Stevenson Creek in Clearwater will fund projects identified in the Stevenson Creek Watershed Master Plan for improvement of stormwater runoff and flood protection in a low-income minority community within the City of Clearwater, known as the North Greenwood community.  This community is in a designated brownfields area and is composed of low to middle-income minority residents.  This area is now plagued by polluted water, flooding problems and offensive odors arising from the pollutant load and sediments which are washed into the creek as stormwater runoff.

This is a continuation of a project approved and funded in the 2000-2001 fiscal year.  Work done to date on the Stevenson Creek Estuary includes developed watershed management plan, sediment analysis in the estuary, installed a sediment sump, installed 2 Continuous Deflective Separators(CDS) units which act to filter out floatable and sinkable sediments.

The appropriation will be used to improve water quality, eliminate offensive odors and provide flood protection.  These have been long-standing needs of this minority community.  It will reshape and stabilize the creek's channel to reduce erosion and pollutant loading, and improve water quality and restore habitat in Clearwater Harbor which is designated an Outstanding Florida Waterbody.

I hope you can help me on this.  Thanks. 


Jack

Dear Govenor Bush,
I am writing to ask for your help in continuing your support of the Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis Nursery Program.  We all realize that there are many worthy programs that need our help.  I believe, when you consider the Crisis Nursery program and continued funding, that you will agree that it meets all the criteria necessary for the continued support of our State Government. It serves so many children and families in a fiscally responsible way keeping families together when possible and out of the "system".
 
Thank you for your consideration of the Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis Nursery, which is included in line item 349 of the recently passed budget. As an enthusiastic supporter of the efforts of the Center, I hope that you will agree that continued funding is essential.

Dear Jeb,

Hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to take a moment and thank you for
all your support and provide some additional food for thought as you make
your final decisions on the budget.  

We really enjoyed our meeting in Tallahassee and hope you haven't cut
yourself on the utility knife.  Whatever you do, please don't use it to cut
our projects. 

The following are the South Miami items included in the Legislature's
Budget.

*	Potable Water (HB1221; Section 25) - As we discussed when we met in
your office, this is our highest priority and is a serious public health
issue.  The money in the bill is not new money, it is reprogrammed money
from a sanitary sewer project approved last year.  David Struhs and crew
have signed off and support the project.
*	
*	Stormwater  Drainage (1747A)  - You experienced first hand the
critical flooding situation in Miami-Dade County.  These drainage projects,
included in the South Florida Water Management District budget, are
essential if we are to prevent repeated flood damage.  With all due respect
to Commissioner Gallagher, his concerns are misplaced.  Solving the South
Florida flooding problem is of vital interest to the entire State and
particularly the insurance industry to stop the continued and repeated
payment of large insurance damage claims that ultimately affect the entire
State.
*	
*	FRDAP Grant for Murray Park (1814) - This is a good project.  It
went through the FRDAP process, was ranked #6 in the entire State and is
well within DEP's FRDAP grant budget. 

*	Emergency Mobile Command Center (1543A) - This project is vital not
only to our own emergency response needs but also those of our sister cities
and region.  Because of our expertise, willingness and proximity to
often-overwhelmed, disaster-prone Miami-Dade communities such as West Miami,
Sweetwater, Homestead/Florida City and to Monroe County, South Miami often
provides emergency response during severe or catastrophic weather events.
We are glad to be able to assist and this would allow us to be much more
effective in helping Pepe Diaz, Rebeca Sosa and our other friends.

*	Rehabilitation of Affordable Housing in the South Miami Target Area
(1597B) - As the President discussed in his recent visit to a Habitat for
Humanity community in Tampa, the provision of affordable housing is a
nationwide issue.  While we can't solve the housing crisis throughout the
country, this project is a significant effort to tackle Miami-Dade County's
housing issues.  The State funding would match funding provided by the South
Miami Community Redevelopment Agency, individual property owners, and
private enterprises, and would enable the public-private partnership to
completely rehabilitate several existing multifamily developments.


Once again, thanks for all your help.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
It has been reported in the media that a number of critical and vital projects for the Treasure Coast are under consideration for veto.  I urge you to take a very serious look at the ramifications of vetoing these projects, and in particular the Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis Nursery.  These programs are an absolute necessity, and tampering with a very successful system does not make any sense!  If Hibiscus is not there to take care of these children, who will?  When making decisions that have such broad dynamics, I do hope you put yourself in the position of standing in another's shoes.  As a child advocate, volunteer and an employee of another non-profit organization, one know's the importance and valuable service such organizations provide. To consider taking valuable resources away from them is just not acceptable.  There are many ways to fund all the programs in this State and I challenge you to figure out how to do that as our leader!
 
Sincerely,
 
Joanne Towner, CFRE

Subject: Funding for the Coordinating Council of Broward


Dear Governor Bush:  

As you consider Florida's budget, I urge favorable consideration of the line 
items affecting the Coordinating Council of Broward.  These items have 
statewide significance and our commitment is to help disseminate the 
experience, systems and knowledge to other counties in Florida.  They also 
have significant local matching funds.  The two items are the Healthy 
Communities Initiative and the Broward Information Network.  The latter is an 
attempt to link the major social service providers including the Workforce 
Development system together electronically into a virtual reality mega human 
service agency.  The following are points to support our request.  The 
projects contain:  

*Systems designed to reduce racial, ethnic and gender disparities in
healthcare access and health status, including the targeted Neighborhood
Projects, the Community Access Program grant and hospital/state health
department/health planning council partnerships for improved access
* Information systems (the BIN) and planning products (CRI and Benchmarks)
which support improved partnerships in health and social services; including
colocation, shared databases, joint planning and budgeting and mutually
supportive multi-agency contracting.
* Documentation of quality of life improvements through statistically valid
community surveys and agency data
* Outreach and transfer of knowledge gained and systems developed to other
counties and districts in Florida
* A local cash match ($267,500) by CCB member agencies far above the 25%
matching funds target.   The CCB member agencies dues and contracts alone are
64% of our $417,500 project total, and The CCB averages over $138,000 for
targeted grants and programs, which further support the Healthy Communities
Initiative.   We seek no fixed capital outlay funding.   We can demonstrate
very high levels of tangible community support from government, nonprofit
and business sectors.

In these projects we have concentrated on community-identified high priority 
improvement projects in education, jobs, health care access and 
transportation.
We have also provided administrative support services not other wise 
obtainable at
comparable costs in state-mandated early childhood development and foster 
care reform, Governor's "Front Porch Florida" community development 
initiative, programs in health, elderly services, juvenile justice and an 
annual statewide conference on neighborhoods.  The BIN has its first agencies 
on line and communicating information about shared clients which has 
generated much local enthusiasm.  

We need the state's continued support. Thank you for your consideration.

Jeb:  Last night at the Brevard School Board meeting, we denied Brevard
Preparatory Academy, with my vote against, for the second time.  A
Republican school board voted 4-1 against a charter high school, ignoring
your cabinet's decision that the school deserved to be chartered.  I bring 2
issues to your attention:
	1. We need multiple sponsorship!!!!  Charter schools will not take
off in Florida until we take the monopoly away from School Boards who are
acting for self-preservation.  Brevard County's increase in students is 40%
charter.  If the trend continues we will have a majority of students in
charter schools and this tolls the end of the traditional school district.
Understandably, administration is running scared.  
	2. The state Republican organization should discipline Republican
school board members who actively obstruct charter schools.  It's hard to
believe, but I think  they are stupid enough to be ignorant of the fact that
they are acting against Republican party interests. 

Soon we will be running for re-election.  Glad to hear your in the running.
See you on the campaign trail again.  I guess I am just a glutton for
punishpment.  I keep hoping I can get a majority on the board that will
support reform.  Hope springs eternal!

The Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor 
State of Florida 
jeb@jeb.org 

Dear Governor Bush: 

I just heard there might be a problem with budget item #1748, my #1 priority in the budget.  I had assumed it was okay since it is a continuation of funding that passed the Water Advisory Panel last year.  I can't reach Kimberly Dale so I thought I would contact you directly.

The appropriation requested for Stevenson Creek in Clearwater will fund projects identified in the Stevenson Creek Watershed Master Plan for improvement of stormwater runoff and flood protection in a low-income minority community within the City of Clearwater, known as the North Greenwood community.  This community is in a designated brownfields area and is composed of low to middle-income minority residents.  This area is now plagued by polluted water, flooding problems and offensive odors arising from the pollutant load and sediments which are washed into the creek as stormwater runoff.

This is a continuation of a project approved and funded in the 2000-2001 fiscal year.  Work done to date on the Stevenson Creek Estuary includes developed watershed management plan, sediment analysis in the estuary, installed a sediment sump, installed 2 Continuous Deflective Separators(CDS) units which act to filter out floatable and sinkable sediments.

The appropriation will be used to improve water quality, eliminate offensive odors and provide flood protection.  These have been long-standing needs of this minority community.  It will reshape and stabilize the creek's channel to reduce erosion and pollutant loading, and improve water quality and restore habitat in Clearwater Harbor which is designated an Outstanding Florida Waterbody.

I hope you can help me on this.  Thanks. 


Jack

I am extremely concerned about your consideration of veto for line item 7B.  When the republicans, especially my father, Ken Davey with the Republican Executive Committee here in Hillsborough County worked to get you elected, it was with the hope that you would be able to initiate  legislation that was not vendor specific, but could help all children educationally.  This legislation is one of the few really powerful pieces that came out of the current session.  I would encourage you to not veto 7B this but allow districts to use these funds to change lives.

Jeb,
I never thought that I would have to call on you in your role as Governor. I
didn't even ever consider the possibility of bothering Armando for his help.
In fact, I am not contacting you as the Chairman of the Department of
Pathology at the University of Miami, but simply I am writing on behalf of
the many children of a lesser God that are cared for at the Mailman Center
for Child Development.
It has been brought to my attention that you may veto the State appropiation
for the Mailman Center. Notwithstanding the many difficult problems that you
have to deal with, and that I do not envy, please keep in mind that this
Center is the only nationally-recognized comprehensive center of excellence
in our State dealing with handicapped and special needs children. One-third,
yes ONE-THIRD, of the children in Florida with severe handicaps, such as
mental retardation, autism and other special needs are provided with
essential and broad services by this Center. Mailman provides the home base
for the team dealing with the huge epidemic problem of severe child abuse.
It also trains nurses, social workers and all sort of professionals dealing
with problems of genetic disorders, learning disabilities, cancer, sickle
cell disease, etc. etc. etc.
It is unlikely that many of these programs can continue without the state
funding.
Jeb, I am grandfather of two beautiful healthy girls. How fortunate am I. It
truly breaks my heart to see these needed children. And precisely because of
them I decided to do what I thought unthinkable, to contact you directly. I
can be contacted at home (305- 667 9664) or in my office (305- 585 6103)
should you wish to discuss this issue or any other. Regards,

I trust that it's not too late to provide you with budget information. I have faxed a copy of today's editorial published in the Daytona Beach News-Journal. An excerpt includes "Other cuts would exact a real toll in human misery and wasted state money. The Community Domiciliary Project at Serenity House which provides treatment to people who are both mentally ill and addicted to drugs is a prime example. The budget allocates $339,000 to the program. It's a bargain considering the program saves taxpayers more than $1 million a year. If they weren't  in the program, historical evidence shows that domiciliary clients would likely be in jail or hospital crisis units, both of which cost much more to operate".
 
The Interdisciplinary Managed Care project assists in the "management" of these clients in diverting them from expensive publicly-funded services.

Governor Bush,

I ask that you support just compensation for those who have billboards.  
Billboards should be considered real property and if taken, those affected 
should be compensated under protection of our national and state 
constitutions.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Gov. Bush should be careful about who he picks for the next Director. One of the candidates is rumored to have fathered the child of a female trooper in palm beach. FHP did a trashy investigation that never included getting a copy of the Birth Certificate or DND test. This story is true and can be proven. He also was rumored to be involved in a long affair with a former Trooper named Pam Andrews ( Now emloyed with the Dade County State Attorney) She refused to be interviewed in the investigation. Another former Trooper Jackie Rojas has photos of the her with the Chief on the sofa at her apt. and will be glad to supply them if asked. Be careful this could be politcal nightmare if Jeb does not take caution and a copy of this warning was printed later. Everybody here at FHP knows these items are true. Why was he pulled as the Bueau Chief in South Florida when the story broke? Trouble in Miami was a cover up. Get the investigation and check out the alpha pages Regina sent him. There are alot of other rumors floating around that may or may not be true but these are confirmed. Jesse Jackson has nothing on this guy. My vote goes to Lee or Knight for the Director.

Jeb,
I never thought that I would have to call on you in your role as Governor. I
didn't even ever consider the possibility of bothering Armando for his help.
In fact, I am not contacting you as the Chairman of the Department of
Pathology at the University of Miami, but simply I am writing on behalf of
the many children of a lesser God that are cared for at the Mailman Center
for Child Development.
It has been brought to my attention that you may veto the State appropiation
for the Mailman Center. Notwithstanding the many difficult problems that you
have to deal with, and that I do not envy, please keep in mind that this
Center is the only nationally-recognized comprehensive center of excellence
in our State dealing with handicapped and special needs children. One-third,
yes ONE-THIRD, of the children in Florida with severe handicaps, such as
mental retardation, autism and other special needs are provided with
essential and broad services by this Center. Mailman provides the home base
for the team dealing with the huge epidemic problem of severe child abuse.
It also trains nurses, social workers and all sort of professionals dealing
with problems of genetic disorders, learning disabilities, cancer, sickle
cell disease, etc. etc. etc.
It is unlikely that many of these programs can continue without the state
funding.
Jeb, I am grandfather of two beautiful healthy girls. How fortunate am I. It
truly breaks my heart to see these needed children. And precisely because of
them I decided to do what I thought unthinkable, to contact you directly. I
can be contacted at home (305- 667 9664) or in my office (305- 585 6103)
should you wish to discuss this issue or any other. Regards,

Subject:	RE: DMS-Service First

This has everything to do with all the personnel officers of all the state agencies.  Throughout the course of the Service First development, agency personnel officers were recognizing that certain individuals were misclassified as management when they were not and non management when they actually were.  Agencies were in fact misclassifying individuals either as a mistake or in order to pay them better.  Plus, among agencies, personnel officers were finding inconsistencies in how like positions were classified.  We asked the agencies to undergo an excercise to ensure that we were appropriately moving managers, supervisors and confidential employees to SES -- they were given the opportunity to ensure that all employees were classified according to what they did -- something they did not have the opportunity to do during the policy development phase.
 
As a result, many employees slated to move to SES will not move and many that were not slated to move will be moved.  This is a collaborative process being worked through will all personnel officers.  As of today, there is about a net increase of 400 employees moving to SES from our initial proposal of 16,300.
 
In addition, those are "positions" -- i was told today that as of now, actual employees impacted is only about 15,500.

Hi, Katie 
Per our phone conversation, here's the email I got early this week from, 
presumably, a DMS employee. I left in the rhetoric only to impart the 
attitude of some of the employees I'm hearing from, not because I 
necessarily believe or disbelieve what they're saying. 
Are there 1,000 more going to SES? I've sent this to K.Anders, 
also. 
bc 
DMS Chief Henderson rewriting Service First rules to classify (target) 
more employees 
In a bold attempt to rewrite and expand Service First to her own liking, 
Cynthia Henderson has directed her operatives to classify additional Career 
Service Class IN ADDITION to those 16,122 voted on by the Legislature.  In 
effect, her unilateral decision to include other classes to those voted on 
and approved by the legislature has the net effect of forcing even more 
career service employees into the SES (at will) classification. 
As you might recall, Senate Bill 466 requires that Career Service Employee 
classifications who are managerial employees (as defined by s.  447.203(4)), 
Supervisory employees, and confidential employees (as defined by s. 
447.203(5)), are to be reclassified as SES employees on July 1, 2001.  Each 
of these career service classifications was identified from COPES data on or 
about February 28, 2001.  This now famous list of career service 
classifications and class titles is what gave us the 16,122 positions that 
are to be moves to SES classification (at will status), and is what the 
Legislature voted on.  The list is summarized in the table below: 
Service First Classification CS Class Code/Classifications Position 
Count 
Managerial Employees 244      4,915 
Supervisory Employees 488    6,867 
Confidential Employees 83      4,330 
Total                             815    16,122 

Each "CS Class Code/Classification" represents a combination of class code 
4-digit number and noun name class title, for example 0159 - Records Center 
Manager.  The Position Count represents the total of each Class 
Code/Classification in state government.  If one adds all of the identified 
and Legislatively approved Class Code/Classifications up, one gets the total 
16,122. 
The list (Career Service to Selected Exempt Service list) quickly became 
popular to Career Service Employees, as one was either "on" (lose your CS 
status and become at will) or you were "not on" (retain your CS status). 
Two of the CS Class Code/Classifications NOT ON the list were: 
2224 Senior Management Analyst I 
2225 Senior Management Analyst II 

Naturally, people in these two CS Class Code/Classifications who did not 
supervise employees were relieved that they would not lose their rights.  At 
the beginning of June in DMS, there were some 8 Senior Management Analyst I 
and 22 Senior Management Analyst II, for a total of 30. 
Two weeks ago, a rumor spread through DMS that additional positions would be 
placed on the list because they were "Confidential".  The definition of 
"Confidential" in 447.203(5) has everything to do with defining terms for 
matters dealing with the Public Employees Relations Commission, and the 
confidentiality of those serving the negotiating managers.  It (this 
definition of Confidential) has nothing to do with classification of the 
myriad Career Service Employee Classifications.  The definition is extremely 
vague, and its use (or deliberate misuse) "Out of Context" by the proponents 
of Service First allows them to classify any position or group of positions 
as "Confidential" because they want to, regardless whether the CS Class 
Code/Classifications was included on the legislatively approved list of 
16,122.  This deliberate abuse or usurping of the Legislative intent is 
occurring at DMS. 
When a DMS Personnel Office manager was asked how these 30 some positions 
(SMAI and SMAII) could be classified as Confidential when they were not on 
the list, the employee said "we could have done this long ago, regardless of 
Service First", which as we all know is untrue.  When it was pointed out 
that the definition of "Confidential" in the Service First law was clearly 
designed to address labor negotiations and not enterprise wide career 
service classifications, the employee said that if the positions were 
thought to have anything to do with policy or management, they could be 
called confidential.  Essentially, whatever Cynthia Henderson wants to 
classify as "confidential" is being classified as such. 
There was subsequently a list of all DMS employees circulated to DMS 
managers (now all Henderson insiders and zealots) which identified each 
employee by name, old CS classification, location, and new service first 
Managerial, Supervisory, or Confidential status.  All of the SMAIs and 
SMAIIs are now classified as "Confidential" employees, essentially added to 
the list by Cynthia's lackeys, and are scheduled to now become Select Exempt 
(at will).  Managers have told those effected SMAI and SMAII that they will 
now be converted to SES. 
These managers are also spouting the party line about what your 
office/job/group's nature of work makes your position now confidential. 
What a crock of opportunistic Bull. 
This is simply a slimy end run by CH to gather even more people into the SES 
ranks so they can be controlled or fired.  At DMS, these two Class 
Code/Classifications, SMAI and SMAII, represent only 30 highly educated and 
experienced employees.  Since CH is spearheading the coupe for JEB we can 
deduce that other agencies are being URGED to classify their SMAIs and 
SMAIIs likewise.   Evidence of these actions can be seen in the recent 
advertisement of an SMAII for a non-supervisor Internal Audit Position at 
the Department of Juvenile Justice.  This position, normally CS, had an 
additional note in the job announcement stating "this position will be 
classified as SES."  If this practice of arbitrarily classifying the SMAIs 
and SMAIIs as "confidential" employees subject to becoming SES is urged and 
carried out in all the governor's agencies, it will result in an additional 
1,039 positions (364 SMAIs and 675 SMAIIs) being added to the 16,122 that 
the Legislation allows! 
What is more ridiculous is the fact that the group, which might have been 
able to stop this abuse of power, has itself been moved under DMS.  The PERC 
organization  (some 50 employees) will be placed under Secretary Henderson 
at DMS on July 1, 2001.  This "arbitrary classification as "Confidential" is 
a more sinister hatchet job than their using the IG's Office to try to smear 
Terry Meek, because they can classify any CS position as "Confidential" 
regardless of the Legislation, thus impact many more people. 

Perhaps if you made this shameless effort public, they would back off and 
only classify those that the law had allowed (the original 16,122) rather 
than let Cynthia Henderson and her hatchet people arbitrarily add positions 
(that is-people) to the governor's hit list.

Hi, Katie
Per our phone conversation, here's the email I got early this week from,
presumably, a DMS employee. I left in the rhetoric only to impart the
attitude of some of the employees I'm hearing from, not because I
necessarily believe or disbelieve what they're saying.
Are there 1,000 more going to SES? I've sent this to K.Anders,
also.

DMS Chief Henderson rewriting Service First rules to classify (target)
more employees
In a bold attempt to rewrite and expand Service First to her own liking,
Cynthia Henderson has directed her operatives to classify additional Career
Service Class IN ADDITION to those 16,122 voted on by the Legislature.  In
effect, her unilateral decision to include other classes to those voted on
and approved by the legislature has the net effect of forcing even more
career service employees into the SES (at will) classification.
As you might recall, Senate Bill 466 requires that Career Service Employee
classifications who are managerial employees (as defined by s.  447.203(4)),
Supervisory employees, and confidential employees (as defined by s.
447.203(5)), are to be reclassified as SES employees on July 1, 2001.  Each
of these career service classifications was identified from COPES data on or
about February 28, 2001.  This now famous list of career service
classifications and class titles is what gave us the 16,122 positions that
are to be moves to SES classification (at will status), and is what the
Legislature voted on.  The list is summarized in the table below:
Service First Classification CS Class Code/Classifications Position
Count
Managerial Employees 244      4,915
Supervisory Employees 488    6,867
Confidential Employees 83      4,330
Total                             815    16,122

Each "CS Class Code/Classification" represents a combination of class code
4-digit number and noun name class title, for example 0159 - Records Center
Manager.  The Position Count represents the total of each Class
Code/Classification in state government.  If one adds all of the identified
and Legislatively approved Class Code/Classifications up, one gets the total
16,122.
The list (Career Service to Selected Exempt Service list) quickly became
popular to Career Service Employees, as one was either "on" (lose your CS
status and become at will) or you were "not on" (retain your CS status).
Two of the CS Class Code/Classifications NOT ON the list were:
2224 Senior Management Analyst I
2225 Senior Management Analyst II

Naturally, people in these two CS Class Code/Classifications who did not
supervise employees were relieved that they would not lose their rights.  At
the beginning of June in DMS, there were some 8 Senior Management Analyst I
and 22 Senior Management Analyst II, for a total of 30.
Two weeks ago, a rumor spread through DMS that additional positions would be
placed on the list because they were "Confidential".  The definition of
"Confidential" in 447.203(5) has everything to do with defining terms for
matters dealing with the Public Employees Relations Commission, and the
confidentiality of those serving the negotiating managers.  It (this
definition of Confidential) has nothing to do with classification of the
myriad Career Service Employee Classifications.  The definition is extremely
vague, and its use (or deliberate misuse) "Out of Context" by the proponents
of Service First allows them to classify any position or group of positions
as "Confidential" because they want to, regardless whether the CS Class
Code/Classifications was included on the legislatively approved list of
16,122.  This deliberate abuse or usurping of the Legislative intent is
occurring at DMS.
When a DMS Personnel Office manager was asked how these 30 some positions
(SMAI and SMAII) could be classified as Confidential when they were not on
the list, the employee said "we could have done this long ago, regardless of
Service First", which as we all know is untrue.  When it was pointed out
that the definition of "Confidential" in the Service First law was clearly
designed to address labor negotiations and not enterprise wide career
service classifications, the employee said that if the positions were
thought to have anything to do with policy or management, they could be
called confidential.  Essentially, whatever Cynthia Henderson wants to
classify as "confidential" is being classified as such.
There was subsequently a list of all DMS employees circulated to DMS
managers (now all Henderson insiders and zealots) which identified each
employee by name, old CS classification, location, and new service first
Managerial, Supervisory, or Confidential status.  All of the SMAIs and
SMAIIs are now classified as "Confidential" employees, essentially added to
the list by Cynthia's lackeys, and are scheduled to now become Select Exempt
(at will).  Managers have told those effected SMAI and SMAII that they will
now be converted to SES.
These managers are also spouting the party line about what your
office/job/group's nature of work makes your position now confidential.
What a crock of opportunistic Bull.
This is simply a slimy end run by CH to gather even more people into the SES
ranks so they can be controlled or fired.  At DMS, these two Class
Code/Classifications, SMAI and SMAII, represent only 30 highly educated and
experienced employees.  Since CH is spearheading the coupe for JEB we can
deduce that other agencies are being URGED to classify their SMAIs and
SMAIIs likewise.   Evidence of these actions can be seen in the recent
advertisement of an SMAII for a non-supervisor Internal Audit Position at
the Department of Juvenile Justice.  This position, normally CS, had an
additional note in the job announcement stating "this position will be
classified as SES."  If this practice of arbitrarily classifying the SMAIs
and SMAIIs as "confidential" employees subject to becoming SES is urged and
carried out in all the governor's agencies, it will result in an additional
1,039 positions (364 SMAIs and 675 SMAIIs) being added to the 16,122 that
the Legislation allows!
What is more ridiculous is the fact that the group, which might have been
able to stop this abuse of power, has itself been moved under DMS.  The PERC
organization  (some 50 employees) will be placed under Secretary Henderson
at DMS on July 1, 2001.  This "arbitrary classification as "Confidential" is
a more sinister hatchet job than their using the IG's Office to try to smear
Terry Meek, because they can classify any CS position as "Confidential"
regardless of the Legislation, thus impact many more people.

Perhaps if you made this shameless effort public, they would back off and
only classify those that the law had allowed (the original 16,122) rather
than let Cynthia Henderson and her hatchet people arbitrarily add positions
(that is-people) to the governor's hit list.

The Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor 
State of Florida

Dear Governor Bush: 

I just heard there might be a problem with budget item #1748, my #1 priority in the budget.  I had assumed it was okay since it is a continuation of funding that passed the Water Advisory Panel last year.  I can't reach Kimberly Dale so I thought I would contact you directly.

The appropriation requested for Stevenson Creek in Clearwater will fund projects identified in the Stevenson Creek Watershed Master Plan for improvement of stormwater runoff and flood protection in a low-income minority community within the City of Clearwater, known as the North Greenwood community.  This community is in a designated brownfields area and is composed of low to middle-income minority residents.  This area is now plagued by polluted water, flooding problems and offensive odors arising from the pollutant load and sediments which are washed into the creek as stormwater runoff.

This is a continuation of a project approved and funded in the 2000-2001 fiscal year.  Work done to date on the Stevenson Creek Estuary includes developed watershed management plan, sediment analysis in the estuary, installed a sediment sump, installed 2 Continuous Deflective Separators(CDS) units which act to filter out floatable and sinkable sediments.

The appropriation will be used to improve water quality, eliminate offensive odors and provide flood protection.  These have been long-standing needs of this minority community.  It will reshape and stabilize the creek's channel to reduce erosion and pollutant loading, and improve water quality and restore habitat in Clearwater Harbor which is designated an Outstanding Florida Waterbody.

I hope you can help me on this.  Thanks. 


Jack

I am writing to support the Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis Nursery 
Program and ask that you not cut the funding for this crucial program.
This program is critical in helping families in our community that are in 
need, and ultimately preventing child abuse and neglect.  Even if it doesn't 
touch you personally, child abuse affects everyone.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Gov. Bush, 
     I would like to urge you to veto CS HB 1053/SB 2056 when it reaches 
your desk because of the billboard language retained in the bill.   

    Recently, I had the opportunity to ride from Thomasville, Ga. to 
Tallahassee. 
It was a real pleasure to ride the highway because there were many miles of 
visual beauty that were not spoiled by the large unsightly billboards that 
are a plague to Florida. 

    The 20,000+ members of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs adopted a 
resolution opposing visual pollution at our annual convention held in 
Orlando.  This resolution was sent to each of our legislators and to you.  In 
spite of much public support, the House and the Senate bills passed in the 
closing hours of the Legislative Session, as did a number of other 
ill-considered issues.  It is my hope that you will not allow this bill to 
become law for the reasons listed below: 

    First, it is bad public policy because it creates special property 
rights for   
                 billboards not enjoyed by other personal property. 
            It overturns years of decisions and planning by local 
governments. 
            It treats Florida cities unequally because of "carveouts" for 
some politically       
                 powerful areas. 
            It will increase the cost of local government and is contrary to 
the provisions 
                 of Article ll Section 7 of the Constitution which requires 
protection of 
                 Florida's scenic beauty. 

    Second, the bill should be vetoed because it is contrary to the 
fundamental 
                 principles of the Republican Party, which believes in equal 
rights, equal 
                 justice and equal opportunity for all.   
           This bill creates a new extra privilege for billboards not 
available to other   
                 types of personal property and treats Florida cities 
unequally. 

    Third, this bill should be vetoed because it is bad politics.   
         The billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida. 
         The bill serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with 
too many v          
                inappropriately placed billboards. 
         The bill is inconsistent with your previous support for decisions 
being made by 
                local government. 

    I ASK THAT YOU WILL VETO THIS BILL THAT HAS LANGUAGE THAT IS CONTRARY TO 
THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF FLORIDIANS. 

Thanking you for considering my ideas, I am 
Sincerely,

I am writing to ask you not veto the funding for the Hibiscus Children's

prevention program that is proven to work.  $190,000 is not a large amount 
to spend for that kind of a result.  I would urge that funds be used to 
prevent abuse in the hope that the number of victims we pay to treat after 
abuse declines.  I can't think of anything we can spend money on that is 
more important than preventing the suffering of children.

Dear Governor Bush,

It was disturbing indeed to see once again that the Tax Watch group has
placed Hibiscus Children's Center's Crisis Nursery Program on its
"turkey" list. I seriously doubt that Mr. Calabro and his group have
ever truly examined this program, its exception cost effectiveness, or,
even more importantly, its results. Should they do even the most cursory
research, they would find that the program has been praised from local
to federal levels as a model for prevention of child abuse. The state of
Florida would do well to not only continue to support this program, but
also to replicate it in other areas of the state.

My familiarity with the program reaches back to its inception, and since
that time, I have been gratified by its continued success in assisting
families to overcome challenges such as substance abuse, domestic
violence, abandonment of a spouse,  the death or serious illness of a
spouse, and a host of other predicaments. Because of Crisis Nursery,
hundreds of children have been able to stay with their families and have
not had to endure the scourge of child abuse.

Governor, you have visited Hibiscus Children's Shelter and seen
firsthand the wonderful work of this program . I cannot believe you
would even for a moment consider shutting it down. I urge you to not
cast out  children and families who would be eligible for this program
by vetoing funding for the Crisis Nursery Program. Your veto would
almost certainly result in many of these children becoming victims of
child abuse or ending up in foster or shelter care. Such a consequence
defies both human and fiscal sense.

Please support funding for this critically needed and eminently
successful program.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush,

I would like to share with you how I truly feel that you need to visit the 
Hibiscus Children' House where they provide shelter for abused children. Most 
importantly, the nursery where babies are given needed love, care and 
attention. As an educator I know the value of a child's environment and the 
impact it has on their success in the public school system. This program has 
been so beneficial to our abused children and wish to share with you the need 
to make certain this program continues. I hope that you will seek the funding 
to keep this program alive for the future of these children, who are not able 
to care for themselves. I believe we need to give them every opportunity to 
succeed, as education begins at an early age. These children may not succeed if 
we are not there to help them.

Thank you for supporting all that you do and I hope that this program is 
important to you as it is to our community and to me.

Dear Mr. Bush - 
 
 I am writing to STRONGLY URGE you not to veto the funding for the Hibiscus 
Children's Center's Crisis Nursery Program.  
 
 Family, Friends, and myself have personally visited the Hibiscus Children's 
Center in Jenson Beach and are very proud to support their programs.  The 
Crisis Nursery is such a needed program - I want to tell you about my first 
visit to the Children's Shelter.
    I was invited to visit the shelter by a friend who had told me about the 
Hibiscus Children's Center.  I learned on the way there that this shelter was 
much more than a 'pit-stop' for the children there.  It was for infants and 
children who had suffered horrible abuse and had no other component or safe 
family to turn to.  
    There was a little boy there that day who was celebrating his 1st 
Birthday.  I wondered where his mother was and after asking learned more than 
I expected.  I was told that he had been at the shelter for 3 months.  He had 
been left neglected & abandoned in his home for 3 days and it wasn't until 
the neighbor called the police because she heard the little boy crying that 
help came.  He was said to be in pretty bad shape.  Can YOU imagine what 
shape this little boy was in after 3 days of no nurturing, no food, no diaper 
changes?
        This special safe shelter was the, 
        HIBISCUS CHILDREN'S CENTER's CRISIS NURSERY PROGRAM    
 
 Please Jeb - help us to help those children who have nowhere else to turn to.
 
 We invite you to visit the shelter and see what a difference it makes in the 
lives of the children.

Dear Governor:

It is my sincere hope that your choices for Florida A&M University's Board of Trustees includes prominent white conservative Republicans. The reason: most blacks have an unfounded irrational hatred or fear of Republicans. Like it or not, they choose to see you as a publicly accepted white supremacist group. This is due directly to the demagoguing of white Republicans by black leaders.

While white conservative Republicans certainly should not dominate FAMU's Board, having a sizable contingent of four or five would force Florida's liberal black leadership to publicly acknowledge and work with them. They would have to credit them for any positive changes that they help bring about, including their assistance in fundraising and lobbying the legislature. 

While the temptation of simply going with black Republicans such as James Corbin and Rudy Bradley would be strong, it would not have the same effect as forcing Kendrick Meek, Al Lawson, Betty Holzendorf, and Alcee Hastings to work with a Bill McCollum or John Thrasher to benefit FAMU and give them their due credit.

Thank you.

Dear Governor: 
You might be surprised that I am writing to you twice in one day.  I might be 
getting into a delicate area but I am going to venture on this path because I 
feel strongly about some things and above all I do not want to hear any 
criticisms about your  leadership. 
I was called by a friend that serves with me on a Board of Directors here in 
Miami. She asked me to write to you to see if you could rethink your decision 
to cut the budget on a social program. Best Buddies. As you know there are 
more than 7.5 million people with mental retardation in the United States, 
many in our State. We are very lucky because we have no one in our families 
with this problem. This program is really providing a very needed service. 
They are very successful educating high schools, college students, corporate, 
community citizens and employers about the needs and abilities of people with 
mental retardation. There have been many mentally retarded individuals that 
have been able to be integrated to their communities, thanks to this program. 
Would you be able to do something about this? I hope you can. I think that 
what they are asking from our State is around $115,000.

I am a Lieutenant with the Florida Highway Patrol and would like to reccomend Chief Chris Knight. I have worked with Chris for the past 20 years and know him to be a upstanding and fair individual who would be an asset to the FHP as the Director. Chris is very well liked by the rank and file members and they would be supportive of his administratition if he is appinted as the FHP Director.

Dear Mr. Bush - 
 
 I am writing to STRONGLY URGE you not to veto the funding for the Hibiscus 
Children's Center's Crisis Nursery Program.  
 
 Family, Friends, and myself have personally visited the Hibiscus Children's 
Center in Jenson Beach and are very proud to support their programs.  The 
Crisis Nursery is such a needed program - I want to tell you about my first 
visit to the Children's Shelter.
    I was invited to visit the shelter by a friend who had told me about the 
Hibiscus Children's Center.  I learned on the way there that this shelter was 
much more than a 'pit-stop' for the children there.  It was for infants and 
children who had suffered horrible abuse and had no other component or safe 
family to turn to.  
    There was a little boy there that day who was celebrating his 1st 
Birthday.  I wondered where his mother was and after asking learned more than 
I expected.  I was told that he had been at the shelter for 3 months.  He had 
been left neglected & abandoned in his home for 3 days and it wasn't until 
the neighbor called the police because she heard the little boy crying that 
help came.  He was said to be in pretty bad shape.  Can YOU imagine what 
shape this little boy was in after 3 days of no nurturing, no food, no diaper 
changes?
        This special safe shelter was the, 
        HIBISCUS CHILDREN'S CENTER's CRISIS NURSERY PROGRAM    
 
 Please Jeb - help us to help those children who have nowhere else to turn to.
 
 We invite you to visit the shelter and see what a difference it makes in the 
lives of the children.

Best Regards,
Tim and Mitz Pfeifer
Vero Beach, FL

Subject:	Legislative Budget Appropriation - Specific Appropriation 1748 Winson Water Plant/North Miami Gravity Sewer System

Dear Jeb:

I want to thank you for the warm reception that I received at the Majority
Dinner last weekend in Orlando.  Your direct efforts to recognize my
community have been greatly appreciated.  I look forward to working with you
in the future.

Once again I need your help.  The City of North Miami has received two
appropriations that will assist us in improving the water and sewer
infrastructure for the Northeast Miami-Dade region.  The Legislature,
through Specific Appropriation # 1748, has appropriated $200,000 for the
Winson Water Plant Emergency Generator System and $400,000 for improvements
to the City's gravity sewer system.

Approval of these requests are vital, not only for the City, but for the
North Miami-Dade region as well.  The City's Water and Sewer System provides
service to close to 100,000 residents and businesses located in the City of
North Miami, the Villages of Miami Shores and Biscayne Park and a
substantial area of unincorporated Miami-Dade County.

The approval of the Winson Water Plant appropriation of $200,000 will ensure
that the City will be able to provide water service to its customers during
and after periods of power outages, such as during hurricanes and other
natural disasters.  The provision of this essential commodity is essential
to any sustained recovery after a natural disaster.

Likewise, the approval of the appropriation for the improvement of the
City's gravity sewer will aid in the elimination of infiltration of
stormwater into the sewer systems.  The unnecessary treatment of stormwater
transmitted by the sewer system to the County's POTW wastes valuable
treatment capacity and incurs unnecessary and high expenses for the
customers of the utility.  The reduction of stormwater from the County's
POTW will increase plant capacity that in turn will allow for further infill
development opportunities in the region.

Both of these improvements are vital to the delivery of services in our
region.  I urge you to join with me, as a fellow Republican, in supporting
the Legislature in the funding of these improvements.  Together, the City of
North Miami and the State of Florida will set the example of partnership in
the provision of regional services and the promotion of sustainable
communities.

Warmest Personal Regards, 

Joe Celestin
Mayor
City of North Miami

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Chief Knight is a very good choice because he is a people trooper. He is well educated. He understands the working Trooper's role as a law enforcement officer and he also understands what the Trooper faces in a day to day role with the motoring public. I am a 29 year veteran of the Florida Highway Patrol and who ever is chosen this will be the last Director I serve under. I would like to see FHP go forward instead of backwards as it did with Grimiing who was chosen from outside the ranks of the highway patrol. Thank you for listening.

Jeb! 

The state funding of the five (5) Florida bowl games is essential if our games are to remain competitive in the football bowl structure. 


These games have a combined $200-million annual economic impact on Florida. 


Our competitor states have government funding and without your support we could lose some of our games.  In fact, Charlotte, NC, is about to steal one. 


Please do not be penny wise and pound foolish.  The taxes alone, paid by the hundreds of thousands of out-of-state bowl fans will replenish the state's funding many times over. 


Please include the $1.0-million funding of our five Florida bowls in your approved budget. 


Thank you,

Subject:	FLORIDA REP. MILLER PLEDGES STRONG LEADERSHIP, LAUNCHES BID FOR CONGRESS

In the years since Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Chumuckla) was 
elected to the Florida Legislature, he's crisscrossed the 
Panhandle hundreds of times.

On Thursday, Miller plans to travel along that familiar 
stretch of roads, stopping in cities and small towns across 
the Panhandle to announce his bid for the First 
Congressional District.

Miller hopes to succeed U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough who is 
vacating his Congressional seat. Scarborough, a four-term 
Republican who was re-elected by a whopping margin in 2000, 
announced last month he would step down to spend more time 
with his sons. Governor Jeb Bush has set a special election 
for October 16, with first and second primaries July 24 and 
Sept. 4.

"Congressman Scarborough stepping down has left a vacuum in 
the U.S. House of Representatives," Miller said. "The 
people of the First Congressional District have pressing 
needs and I am in the best position to fulfill them."

Since his election to the Florida Legislature in 1998, 
Miller has been called a consensus-builder that can work 
with diverse personalities to achieve common goals. A 
strong fiscal conservative, Miller has championed lower 
taxes, development of North-South hurricane evacuation 
routes, and advocated stewardship of the environment.  

The scheduled stops in Miller's tour of cities include: the 
boardwalk along the Blackwater River in Milton; the 
Okaloosa County Courthouse in Crestview; Liza Jackson Park 
in Fort Walton; and the Escambia County Courthouse in 
downtown Pensacola.  Last week, Miller made appearances in 
Walton, Holmes and Bay Counties.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush,

I would like to share with you how I truly feel that you need to visit the 
Hibiscus Children' House where they provide shelter for abused children. Most 
importantly, the nursery where babies are given needed love, care and 
attention. As an educator I know the value of a child's environment and the 
impact it has on their success in the public school system. This program has 
been so beneficial to our abused children and wish to share with you the need 
to make certain this program continues. I hope that you will seek the funding 
to keep this program alive for the future of these children, who are not able 
to care for themselves. I believe we need to give them every opportunity to 
succeed, as education begins at an early age. These children may not succeed if 
we are not there to help them.

Thank you for supporting all that you do and I hope that this program is 
important to you as it is to our community and to me.

Chief Knight has over 10 years of service remaining, which is one of the significant factors needing to be considered when choosing the leader of an organization. I believe you will find that Chief Knights past record will confirm that he will use these years to implement the positive changes necessary for improving the conditions of the Florida Highway Patrol to better serve the citizens of our Great state.

Dear Governor Bush,

It was disturbing indeed to see once again that the Tax Watch group has
placed Hibiscus Children's Center's Crisis Nursery Program on its
"turkey" list. I seriously doubt that Mr. Calabro and his group have
ever truly examined this program, its exception cost effectiveness, or,
even more importantly, its results. Should they do even the most cursory
research, they would find that the program has been praised from local
to federal levels as a model for prevention of child abuse. The state of
Florida would do well to not only continue to support this program, but
also to replicate it in other areas of the state.

My familiarity with the program reaches back to its inception, and since
that time, I have been gratified by its continued success in assisting
families to overcome challenges such as substance abuse, domestic
violence, abandonment of a spouse,  the death or serious illness of a
spouse, and a host of other predicaments. Because of Crisis Nursery,
hundreds of children have been able to stay with their families and have
not had to endure the scourge of child abuse.

Governor, you have visited Hibiscus Children's Shelter and seen
firsthand the wonderful work of this program . I cannot believe you
would even for a moment consider shutting it down. I urge you to not
cast out  children and families who would be eligible for this program
by vetoing funding for the Crisis Nursery Program. Your veto would
almost certainly result in many of these children becoming victims of
child abuse or ending up in foster or shelter care. Such a consequence
defies both human and fiscal sense.

Please support funding for this critically needed and eminently
successful program.

Subject:	Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis Nursery Program.

I am writing to ask you not veto the funding for the Hibiscus Children's 
Center Crisis Nursery Program.  This is an excellent abuse and neglect 
prevention program that is proven to work.  $190,000 is not a large amount 
to spend for that kind of a result.  I would urge that funds be used to 
prevent abuse in the hope that the number of victims we pay to treat after 
abuse declines.  I can't think of anything we can spend money on that is 
more important than preventing the suffering of children.

Sincerely,

Subject:	HB 1053

Dear Gov. Bush, 
     I would like to urge you to veto CS HB 1053/SB 2056 when it reaches 
your desk because of the billboard language retained in the bill.   

    Recently, I had the opportunity to ride from Thomasville, Ga. to 
Tallahassee. 
It was a real pleasure to ride the highway because there were many miles of 
visual beauty that were not spoiled by the large unsightly billboards that 
are a plague to Florida. 

    The 20,000+ members of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs adopted a 
resolution opposing visual pollution at our annual convention held in 
Orlando.  This resolution was sent to each of our legislators and to you.  In 
spite of much public support, the House and the Senate bills passed in the 
closing hours of the Legislative Session, as did a number of other 
ill-considered issues.  It is my hope that you will not allow this bill to 
become law for the reasons listed below: 

    First, it is bad public policy because it creates special property 
rights for   
                 billboards not enjoyed by other personal property. 
            It overturns years of decisions and planning by local 
governments. 
            It treats Florida cities unequally because of "carveouts" for 
some politically       
                 powerful areas. 
            It will increase the cost of local government and is contrary to 
the provisions 
                 of Article ll Section 7 of the Constitution which requires 
protection of 
                 Florida's scenic beauty. 

    Second, the bill should be vetoed because it is contrary to the 
fundamental 
                 principles of the Republican Party, which believes in equal 
rights, equal 
                 justice and equal opportunity for all.   
           This bill creates a new extra privilege for billboards not 
available to other   
                 types of personal property and treats Florida cities 
unequally. 

    Third, this bill should be vetoed because it is bad politics.   
         The billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida. 
         The bill serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with 
too many v          
                inappropriately placed billboards. 
         The bill is inconsistent with your previous support for decisions 
being made by 
                local government. 

    I ASK THAT YOU WILL VETO THIS BILL THAT HAS LANGUAGE THAT IS CONTRARY TO 
THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF FLORIDIANS. 

Thanking you for considering my ideas, I am 
Sincerely,

The Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor 
State of Florida 
jeb@jeb.org 

Dear Governor Bush: 

I just heard there might be a problem with budget item #1748, my #1 priority in the budget.  I had assumed it was okay since it is a continuation of funding that passed the Water Advisory Panel last year.  I can't reach Kimberly Dale so I thought I would contact you directly.

The appropriation requested for Stevenson Creek in Clearwater will fund projects identified in the Stevenson Creek Watershed Master Plan for improvement of stormwater runoff and flood protection in a low-income minority community within the City of Clearwater, known as the North Greenwood community.  This community is in a designated brownfields area and is composed of low to middle-income minority residents.  This area is now plagued by polluted water, flooding problems and offensive odors arising from the pollutant load and sediments which are washed into the creek as stormwater runoff.

This is a continuation of a project approved and funded in the 2000-2001 fiscal year.  Work done to date on the Stevenson Creek Estuary includes developed watershed management plan, sediment analysis in the estuary, installed a sediment sump, installed 2 Continuous Deflective Separators(CDS) units which act to filter out floatable and sinkable sediments.

The appropriation will be used to improve water quality, eliminate offensive odors and provide flood protection.  These have been long-standing needs of this minority community.  It will reshape and stabilize the creek's channel to reduce erosion and pollutant loading, and improve water quality and restore habitat in Clearwater Harbor which is designated an Outstanding Florida Waterbody.

I hope you can help me on this.  Thanks.

Governor Bush & Cabinet Personnel, Thank you for the opportunity for the rank and file to express their choice for the new director of the Florida Highway Patrol. I am sure all candidates are exceptional people. I, however would like to see Chief Knight as our new director. He will have a positive impact on F.H.P. Chief Knight and I go way back to when I was a young trooper and came in contact with him on I-75 in Ft. Myers. He has always been upbeat and very professional. The decision will not be an easy one, but please keep it within the Patrol. It is hard to believe that out of 2,000 patrol personnel, we could not have one qualified person to become our new director. Thank you again for this opportunity.

Dear Governor Bush:
Please accept this a very strong expression of support for General Revenue,
Specific Appropriation 194 Harbor Beanch Marine Science - FAU $950,000.
These funds are for the funding a full year of the "Semester by the Sea"
marine science program.  Demand for the pilot of this program was far
greater than expected, and based on the pilot program, it is expected that
baccalaureate, masters and doctorial students and research scientists from
around the world will attend.  This is an opportunity for Florida to promote
worldwide its natural treasures and the Indian River Lagoon, and to
eventually attract commerce related to these industries.
As President of the St. Lucie County Chamber of Commerce and local attorney,
I urge your support of this program.  It has much to offer the State of
Florida and the region.
Respectfully yours,

Subject:	RE: Air Service

Neil,

What was outlined to me by the CEO at "Airline X" was the following:

*  Revenue guarantee at $50K per month for 4 flights daily to TLH-TPA &
TLH-MIA.  This guarantee would rise to $100K approx. if service was extended
between TLH-ATL.  If ridership is sufficient, guarantee could zero itself
out.  "Airline X" claims that using a conservative model, they would save
Tallahassee area $32 million in the first year alone due to lower fares.

*  A reduction in fees/lease at airport.

*  Assistance with promotions of service.  Apparently there is some fund
they've identified which can be applied here.

*  Directed influence in opening up MIA for a new TLH leg of service.


Things to address before or at the meeting include:


Determining the extent to which we can encourage "Airline X" to enter the
TLH market, while not upsetting fair market forces/practices.  Essentially,
can we offer up special stuff to "Airline X" not also extended to USAir?

We need figures on the actual traffic going in and out of city, county,
state, and university.  

We need to inquire as to whether "Airline X" will offer up a set low price
for govt travel--beyond their regular fares and Internet fares.  This is
particularly important as much govt travel is planned at last minute when
fares are the highest (even for "Airline X").  

Each of our govt bodies (state, county, city, university) have their own
procurement contracts and procedures.  Each would need to be in the loop on
this.

Finally, TLH-MCO is also a big market for us.  I asked whether "Airline X"
would consider this market as well.  Initial reaction from CEO was less than
receptive but he did indicate he would go back and have his team look at the
numbers.  We should discuss this leg of travel further.

Pam - Sue and I were discussing several issues yesterday afternoon and the
subject of Tallahassee air service came up - she mentioned that the two of
you had talked about some new info on "Airline X" and you were interested in
getting a copy of "Airline X's" proposed package - here is what I have from
a
previous discussion with them and I think its pretty consistent with what
you and I discussed:

     * Free rent and reduced/free landing fees for six months to a year

     *  A decent size marketing budget - can be set up on a 50/50 match
basis i.e.
        for every dollar they spend, Tallahassee would spend the same
amount up to
        a cap limit - the range would be $50K to $100K

     *  A revenue guarantee by some entity on behalf of the business
community for
        a specified number of seats per plane/per destination or some other
creative
        combination lasting 6 months to a year - I think this is where we
can really put
        something together that will never come into play

     * it was suggested that the community recommend specific routes that
make sense
        for both the community and the airline - the best thing I've heard
about your recent
        contact is that they would continue w/ flights into south Florida -
this is big and keeps
        them from just competing with Delta on an Atlanta/Tallahassee route

     Let me know the next step - look forward to working with you on this
significant project

This message is to request your veto on HB 1053 - the "Billboards Forever"

This bill constitutes bad public policy.  It creates special rights for

It is an unfunded mandate to local governments, many of which cannot afford
the expense of paying these entities to remove their despoiling structures.

It basically usurps local ordinances.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
It has been reported in the media that a number of critical and vital projects for the Treasure Coast are under consideration for veto.  I urge you to take a very serious look at the ramifications of vetoing these projects, and in particular the Hibiscus Children's Center Crisis Nursery.  These programs are an absolute necessity, and tampering with a very successful system does not make any sense!  If Hibiscus is not there to take care of these children, who will?  When making decisions that have such broad dynamics, I do hope you put yourself in the position of standing in another's shoes.  As a child advocate, volunteer and an employee of another non-profit organization, one know's the importance and valuable service such organizations provide. To consider taking valuable resources away from them is just not acceptable.  There are many ways to fund all the programs in this State and I challenge you to figure out how to do that as our leader!
 
Sincerely,

To: The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush

I am so disheartened that this issue of the funding for the Hibiscus Crisis
Nursery Program has not been resolved in favor of continuation.  I was under
the impression that you viewed this program as a model program, one that
others throughout the State might one day launch ... so we can truly attack
child abuse at the beginning of its treacherous cycle.  I have taken the
liberty of emailing you the following letter to the Editor (Stuart News)
which I submitted in March.  It was published and I received numerous
responses from those who hadn't quite "gotten" the picture from a
perspective that illustrates how big a bang for the buck this Crisis Nursery
Program delivers.

Please do not bother to have one of your aids send me a proforma response
(as I have received the last two times I've emailed or faxed you).  While I
do not wish to seem ungrateful for the prompt system you have in place to
respond to correspondence, these "form letters" mainly convince me, perhaps
erroneously, that you do not read the impassioned pleas yourself.   For
God's sake, please take one second to look into your heart before you strike
a pen across this vital Crisis Program.  We've worked so diligently for
years to get it on it's feet ... and proved with the highest possible
success rates each year that it is worthy of the State funding that enables
it to continue existence.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT:        Gubernatorial Vetoes 

As many of you are now aware, it is very likely that Governor Bush will be exercising his line-item veto quite a bit this week.   With budget projections already down and the loss of revenue from the federal government through the elimination of the "death tax," Florida needs to have sufficient reserves available for the coming fiscal year.  That said, you should be prepared to hear from the Governor's staff about your specific community projects and the potential that they will be vetoed.

Gubernatorial vetoes are not something new and I have had to deal with disappointment of losing a project that I worked hard to pass.  If you are contacted and it appears that you might loose one or more projects, please don't be discouraged or take it out on our Governor.  Even though it may be removed from the budget, you should still take credit for getting it there in the first place.  As for the Governor, he has a job to do, like the rest of us, and he was elected to make these kinds of tough choices.  None of us like to make them, but if we want to continue funding education, health care, environmental protection and public safety programs statewide, all of us have to realize that some of our local concerns may not get through the process all the time.

Finally, I would ask that you hold back from calling the Governor's office about this issue.  You should be hearing from them shortly either way and they are doing the best they can to contact all members about this.  

If you have any concerns or questions, please let me or my staff know in the Majority Office.  We are here to help.

Dear Jeb,

Hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to take a moment and thank you for
all your support and provide some additional food for thought as you make
your final decisions on the budget.  

We really enjoyed our meeting in Tallahassee and hope you haven't cut
yourself on the utility knife.  Whatever you do, please don't use it to cut
our projects. 

The following are the South Miami items included in the Legislature's
Budget.

*	Potable Water (HB1221; Section 25) - As we discussed when we met in
your office, this is our highest priority and is a serious public health
issue.  The money in the bill is not new money, it is reprogrammed money
from a sanitary sewer project approved last year.  David Struhs and crew
have signed off and support the project.
*	
*	Stormwater  Drainage (1747A)  - You experienced first hand the
critical flooding situation in Miami-Dade County.  These drainage projects,
included in the South Florida Water Management District budget, are
essential if we are to prevent repeated flood damage.  With all due respect
to Commissioner Gallagher, his concerns are misplaced.  Solving the South
Florida flooding problem is of vital interest to the entire State and
particularly the insurance industry to stop the continued and repeated
payment of large insurance damage claims that ultimately affect the entire
State.
*	
*	FRDAP Grant for Murray Park (1814) - This is a good project.  It
went through the FRDAP process, was ranked #6 in the entire State and is
well within DEP's FRDAP grant budget. 

*	Emergency Mobile Command Center (1543A) - This project is vital not
only to our own emergency response needs but also those of our sister cities
and region.  Because of our expertise, willingness and proximity to
often-overwhelmed, disaster-prone Miami-Dade communities such as West Miami,
Sweetwater, Homestead/Florida City and to Monroe County, South Miami often
provides emergency response during severe or catastrophic weather events.
We are glad to be able to assist and this would allow us to be much more
effective in helping Pepe Diaz, Rebeca Sosa and our other friends.

*	Rehabilitation of Affordable Housing in the South Miami Target Area
(1597B) - As the President discussed in his recent visit to a Habitat for
Humanity community in Tampa, the provision of affordable housing is a
nationwide issue.  While we can't solve the housing crisis throughout the
country, this project is a significant effort to tackle Miami-Dade County's
housing issues.  The State funding would match funding provided by the South
Miami Community Redevelopment Agency, individual property owners, and
private enterprises, and would enable the public-private partnership to
completely rehabilitate several existing multifamily developments.


Once again, thanks for all your help.

Jeb, 
Diane and I have left a message for Dwaine Raynor to call us. Jeb, this is a 
very controversial subject on local level and will be a disaster for you if 
you sign it into law. Diane said, there are phone calls being made and 
letters being mailed that you and Dwaine have not received. Dwaine needs to 
call all the present board members to get their individual stand on this 
bill. The majority has expressed a view of being against BILL 1903 and think 
it should be vetoed. The previous board had taken a stand on the bill. the 
new board was not advised by staff members that a new position was 
appropriate.  Also, at the time Dwaine Raynor called to poll the board 
members, I did not know who he was and I were reluctant to discuss the issues 
with him. The new board didn't know the implications and ramifications that 
BILL 1903 would cause until sitting on the board for a couple of months. My 
personal recommendations is to veto the BILL.  We wanted to get this message

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Thank you for the opportunity to express my opinon. I am a 16 year veteran of the Florida Highway Patrol and I am a second generation trooper. I am very proud to be one of Florida's state troopers. Consistant leadership is what I see as FHP's most pressing need. I believe Chris Knight will provide this leadership. He is also young enough to provide progressive and innovative leadership for many years. I believe Chris Knight will make changes in the FHP that will keep FHP a top law enforcement agency by state and national standards. I also believe he will maintain the discipline and motivation that is needed to increase the ever sagging morale. I know I will not agree with all of Chris Knight's decisions and programs but I feel he will do the best job for everyone. Change is hard and I have no doubt that the changes that Chris Knight will bring will be hard for me to accept. If you are not changing, you are not growing. The lack of change and growth the last three years has really hurt the FHP both in the public's eye and inside the rank and file. All the applicants are fine professionals and I do not envy your task. Again thank you for this opportunity.

Governor,

You have asked each of us to give you a yes or no call on bills and budget
items.

On HB 1053, my recommendation is that you sign the bill.  While it is quite
long, to my knowledge their is only one section (#6) that was not included
in
the bill during the Committee review process.  All other sections were
either
in the original committee drafts, were amendments that were added in
committee,
or were other bills added that had been heard in committee (e.g. road
designations).

The bill contains nearly everything the Department asked for, including
additional right-of-way and bridge bonding capacity, our re-org package
(including the Turnpike Enterprise), delegation authority to local
government
to streamline permitting, employee bidding and many technical modifications.

Subject:	Funding for the Coordinating Council of Broward

Dear Governor Bush:  

As you consider Florida's budget, I urge favorable consideration of the line 
items affecting the Coordinating Council of Broward.  These items have 
statewide significance and our commitment is to help disseminate the 
experience, systems and knowledge to other counties in Florida.  They also 
have significant local matching funds.  The two items are the Healthy 
Communities Initiative and the Broward Information Network.  The latter is an 
attempt to link the major social service providers including the Workforce 
Development system together electronically into a virtual reality mega human 
service agency.  The following are points to support our request.  The 
projects contain:  

*Systems designed to reduce racial, ethnic and gender disparities in
healthcare access and health status, including the targeted Neighborhood
Projects, the Community Access Program grant and hospital/state health
department/health planning council partnerships for improved access
* Information systems (the BIN) and planning products (CRI and Benchmarks)
which support improved partnerships in health and social services; including
colocation, shared databases, joint planning and budgeting and mutually
supportive multi-agency contracting.
* Documentation of quality of life improvements through statistically valid
community surveys and agency data
* Outreach and transfer of knowledge gained and systems developed to other
counties and districts in Florida
* A local cash match ($267,500) by CCB member agencies far above the 25%
matching funds target.   The CCB member agencies dues and contracts alone are
64% of our $417,500 project total, and The CCB averages over $138,000 for
targeted grants and programs, which further support the Healthy Communities
Initiative.   We seek no fixed capital outlay funding.   We can demonstrate
very high levels of tangible community support from government, nonprofit
and business sectors.

In these projects we have concentrated on community-identified high priority 
improvement projects in education, jobs, health care access and 
transportation.
We have also provided administrative support services not other wise 
obtainable at
comparable costs in state-mandated early childhood development and foster 
care reform, Governor's "Front Porch Florida" community development 
initiative, programs in health, elderly services, juvenile justice and an 
annual statewide conference on neighborhoods.  The BIN has its first agencies 
on line and communicating information about shared clients which has 
generated much local enthusiasm.  

We need the state's continued support. Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:	USF Board Appointment

Dear Governor Bush:

Recently I received a letter from your office indicating that my name had 
been suggested for appointment to the Board of Trustees for the University of 
South Florida. I am not sure of where that suggestion came from, and I had 
not planned to apply, but based on the letter I received, I submitted my 
application. In staffing these new boards, it will be important to make sure 
that as many as possible of those appointed will bring to the board a working 
understanding and institutional knowledge of the university they will govern. 

The more I consider it, the more interested I am in serving and I just wanted 
you to know that I would really appreciate your appointing me to the board.

I would bring considerable institution knowledge to the board and have been 
close to USF since the very beginning. My involvement includes:

ü   Participation in the groundbreaking ceremonies in 1958
ü   Participation in the charter class convocation in 1960
ü   Graduation as an honor student in the charter graduating class
ü   Served as national USF Alumni Association president
ü   Served on the USF Foundation Board of Directors
ü   Served for five years on the faculty and was the first USF graduate 
appointed to faculty rank
ü   Created the John and Beverley Grant Endowed Chair for Free Enterprise in 
the USF College of Business
ü   Currently teaching as an adjunct faculty member in the Department of 
Political Science
ü   First USF graduate to be elected to the Florida Senate
ü   Named as a "Distinguished Alumni" of USF
ü   Served as Chairman of the Senate Education committee during the initial 
phases of university and higher education reorganization
ü   Served on the Senate education budget sub committee
ü   Currently on the USF campus, with the Office of Public Guardian, housed 
in the Florida Mental Health Institute complex
ü   For my 21 years of legislative service, I sponsored or cosponsored almost 
all of the USF related statutory and appropriations matters. As such, O am 
intimately knowledgeable with most aspects of USF programs and 
administration. I have personally visited with the dean and faculty 
representatives of every college on the campus.
ü   Founding trustee of the Shriner's Children's Hospital located on the USF 
campus
ü   Currently serving on the board of the Moffitt Cancer Center, located on 
the campus

Thanks you for considering this application favorably. Please know that I 
would consider it an honor to receive your appointment to this board. It 
would be exciting and challenging to serve my alma mater in this manner and 
would be the pinnacle of a 43 year relationship with USF.

Governor,
 
I had a chance to obtain some additional information concerning Lake Alfred. I have not shared this info as of yet with the concerned citizens of the town.
 
The matter has been sent to the Joint Legislative Auditing Committee (JLAC). The committee is not scheduled to meet until the end of the month. At that time the committee may direct the Auditor General (AG) to begin the audit. However, the Auditor General's audit staff is involved in the mandatory federal audit of the Florida School Districts. This precludes the AGs office from beginning any work on the Lake Alfred matter until January 2002 at the earliest.

Specifically, we need help with the following: 
     1) 500 citizens (including more than the 20% required of registered 
voters) signed a petition which has been sent to the Joint Committee on 
Auditing requesting the Auditor General do a complete financial and 
operational audit of our city's finance department- we need this done as 
quickly as possible as there may be steps being taken to distroy records that 
may be needed during this audit. 
      2) Our city manager has a history of lying to the public which has 
destroyed public confidence in our local government. Appearances of collusion 
and conducting business outside of the sunshine are evident constantly among 
the manager and four of the five commissioners. 
      3)  Several thousands of dollars in utility payments are missing and 
an in-house police investigation has not come to a conclusion after nearly a 
year.  It is thought that the city manager and at least one commissioner are 
protecting the suspect in order to protect themselves. 
      4) The city manager and one of the commissioners are having affairs 
with city employees which creates many problems with the work environment, 
not to mention the potential for sexual harrassment lawsuits if things go bad. 
      5) Past employees and citizens are struggling to seek assistance from 
various state departments with complaints relative to ethics, public record 
availability, and tampering with employee files. 
      6) Citizens are constantly complaining about harrassment from the city 
manager, but only get disrespect from the city commission when they try to 
address it. 
      The City of Lake Alfred experienced a computer crash in 1996, which 
even to today's newspaper, is the manager's excuse for all of the financial 
problems- even our utility bills have not been on time since since last 
October 2000 (running 1-2 months late). 

Whatever help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. Please feel 
free to call if you need more information or the names of former employees 
and citizens who are directly involved. Thank you.

Jeb:  Last night at the Brevard School Board meeting, we denied Brevard
Preparatory Academy, with my vote against, for the second time.  A
Republican school board voted 4-1 against a charter high school, ignoring
your cabinet's decision that the school deserved to be chartered.  I bring 2
issues to your attention:
	1. We need multiple sponsorship!!!!  Charter schools will not take
off in Florida until we take the monopoly away from School Boards who are
acting for self-preservation.  Brevard County's increase in students is 40%
charter.  If the trend continues we will have a majority of students in
charter schools and this tolls the end of the traditional school district.
Understandably, administration is running scared.  
	2. The state Republican organization should discipline Republican
school board members who actively obstruct charter schools.  It's hard to
believe, but I think  they are stupid enough to be ignorant of the fact that
they are acting against Republican party interests. 

Soon we will be running for re-election.  Glad to hear your in the running.
See you on the campaign trail again.  I guess I am just a glutton for
punishpment.  I keep hoping I can get a majority on the board that will
support reform.  Hope springs eternal!

Circuit which needs to justify a decision to construct a multi-building
campus in St. Pete when it has 175,000 square feet of vacant space in
Boston.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I hope Ringling Museum's stable continuance and bright future is not in peril.  Please sign the bill that will provide long awaited and desperately needed funding.  The State of Florida has owned the Museum over fifty years and during most of that time the State has under funded and reduced its allocations with detrimental results. Important structural repairs have been deferred, such as a leaking Art Building roof.  The Art Library,one of the best in the southeast, has no shelf space left and little availability for research. The historic Asolo Theatre was closed because it is in such poor condition. The theatre was used for Museum meetings as well as lectures and performances. There is no other space for this purpose so teacher training, staff, volunteer and special groups now meet outside under a old portico of the building.  Today during a Volunteer Advisory Council meeting it was joked that we have no difficulty working within Florida Sunshine Standards because we work in sunshine. The important conservation of  500 years of Western European artworks is restricted and the need for more climate controlled storage is critical.  There is no classroom space and K-12 education statewide outreach and other programming is limited.
 
Because of decades of apathetic appropriations, I feel this year's support in the Legislature is an anomaly - the only chance the Museum will ever have to receive this level of funding. It will enable the Museum to rise above a subsistence existence and achieve its mission to provide exciting learning opportunities, exposure and exploration for all the people of Florida.  We should nurture the soul, spirit and intellect of our citizens.    
 
                                                                                             Sincerely yours,

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush and Cabinet, This letter is to offer my recommendation for the selection of the new Director of the Florida Highway Patrol which will be decided on soon. My recommendation goes to Chief Chris Knight. I know the Chief to be a young, innovative, enthusiastic, and intelligent administrator. Chief Knight has more than ten years of service left with our department and I believe Chief Knight will use his time left to serve for the complete betterment of the Florida Highway Patrol. I believe Chief Knight would bring around a positive moral change and effective overall changes that the Florida Highway Patol desperatly needs. Thank You for letting me submit my recommendation

Subject:	Ringling Art Museum

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I hope Ringling Museum's stable continuance and bright future is not in peril.  Please sign the bill that will provide long awaited and desperately needed funding.  The State of Florida has owned the Museum over fifty years and during most of that time the State has under funded and reduced its allocations with detrimental results. Important structural repairs have been deferred, such as a leaking Art Building roof.  The Art Library,one of the best in the southeast, has no shelf space left and little availability for research. The historic Asolo Theatre was closed because it is in such poor condition. The theatre was used for Museum meetings as well as lectures and performances. There is no other space for this purpose so teacher training, staff, volunteer and special groups now meet outside under a old portico of the building.  Today during a Volunteer Advisory Council meeting it was joked that we have no difficulty working within Florida Sunshine Standards because we work in sunshine. The important conservation of  500 years of Western European artworks is restricted and the need for more climate controlled storage is critical.  There is no classroom space and K-12 education statewide outreach and other programming is limited.
 
Because of decades of apathetic appropriations, I feel this year's support in the Legislature is an anomaly - the only chance the Museum will ever have to receive this level of funding. It will enable the Museum to rise above a subsistence existence and achieve its mission to provide exciting learning opportunities, exposure and exploration for all the people of Florida.  We should nurture the soul, spirit and intellect of our citizens.    
 
                                                                                             Sincerely yours,

Dear Governor Bush, 
   I sincerely hope that you will veto the "Billboard" bill.  This bill 
removes control from the local governments.  The local citizens, who must 
view these billboards day after day, are truly the ones who should make 
the decisions.  Personally, I think billboards are terribly unsightly in 
urban as well as in rural areas. 
   Recently, the Orlando/Orange County local government negotiated a 
settlement regarding local billboards:  I believe it was a 10 year phase 
out with payments to the owners of the billboards to recompense them for 
their lost advertising.  My understanding is that this settlement will be 
thrown out unless you veto Bill 1053.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush and Lt. Governor Brogan, 

I am a nominee for a position on the Florida Gulf Coast University Board of 
Trustees and wanted to contact you to convey how eager I am to serve you and 
the Florida educational system in this capacity.  As you may recall, Alex 
Sanchez of the Florida Bankers Association met with you last week regarding 
my appointment to further emphasize my qualifications, as well as my 
commitment to education.  I truly believe that education is the key to our 
future and I would delight in the opportunity to contribute and serve in the 
Florida Educational system as a member of the Florida Gulf Coast University 
Board of Trustees.  As I am sure Alex conveyed to you, the banking community 
is committed to deeper involvement in the community, and as a Private Banker 
at AmSouth Bank, this is my goal as well.  In addition to my role as Private 
Banker, I also serve as our Community Reinvestment Act liaison to the 
community.  It is my mission to ensure that AmSouth Bank helps meet the 
credit needs of the Lee/Collier/Charlotte County communities, including low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods and minority owned businesses.  This 
mission is certainly in harmony with that of the University and the Small 
Business Administration division administered by Dan Rigalski at FGCU.   

I realize the Lt. Governor is playing an integral role in this crucial 
selection process.  Through my work with the "Uncommon Friends" foundation, I 
have had the opportunity to meet and get to know Frank, and I am truly 
thrilled with his involvement in this selection process and applaud his 
commitment to education.   

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Alex Sanchez to discuss my 
qualifications, and for your kind consideration of my nomination.  I am 
keenly aware of the many qualified nominations which have poured into your 
office for positions on the Board of Trustees.  However, I believe that what 
sets me apart from the other FGCU Board nominees is not the fact that I am 
the only nominee who is a graduate of FGCU, but that I am passionate about 
education, and have a demonstrated dedication to education.

Dear Mr. Rose,
Thank you for your patience regarding Mr. Washington.  I received the background information I mentioned a few weeks ago on Mr. Washington today, so I am better able to respond to your requests.  Although the evidence against Mr. Washington appears substantial, you could encourage him to send an application for a waiver of the Rules of Executive Clemency and an application for Executive Clemency to The Office of Executive Clemency, 2601 Blairstone Road, Tallahassee, FL 32399.  After sending in these applications and if Mr. Washington receives sufficient support from the Clemency Board (i.e., the Governor and Cabinet), the Parole Commission will conduct an investigation into the circumstances of his conviction.  You may request these application forms by calling the Office of Executive Clemency at (850) 488-2952.
 
To be fair, you should know that very few inmates are freed from prison by the Clemency Board.  In my opinion, Mr. Washington's chances are not particularly strong.  The information I received showed that his fingerprints were found at the murder scene.  Nonetheless, Mr. Washington is free to seek a commutation of his sentence from the Clemency Board and this office will fully review any evidence submitted that tends to disprove his guilt.
 
According to Gulf Correctional Institute, you can arrange a visit with Mr. Washington by obtaining a visitation application from Mr. Washington and submitting it to the Central Visitation Authority.  The address of the authority is on the application.  You can also request a visit using a toll-free number (877-822-1987) (or call 850-487-8134 in Tallahassee), but I understand it is very difficult to get through on this number.
 
I understand that it must be difficult to have a former student insisting upon his innocence, and I appreciate your desire to see that justice is served.  I share that desire and I will assist you as much as is permissible if Mr. Washington submits an application for clemency.  Thank you for contacting the Governor's Office.
 
Sincerely,
Greg Munson

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to you to request that you support Kids Bridge Supervised
Family Visitation Center that is currently being considered as part of your
budget. As President of the Junior Service League of St. Augustine, I have
been greatly involved with this project and am excited about our partnership
with Children's Home Society who will be assisting us with the day-to-day
operations.  I know that you have many other agencies and projects on your
list requesting approval and that you may thinking that this is just another
visitation center, but our center and endeavors to get it open are quite
unique.  Please allow me to explain..............

Four years ago, Honorable Robert Mathis and Honorable John Alexander saw a
need for such a facility in St. John's County, and knew exactly where to
turn for help in establishing such a facility.  Through our commitment and
dedication to the community of St. Johns County, we were able to completely
restore the St. Augustine Lightkeeper's House which is now the St. Augustine
Lighthouse & Museum when it burned to the ground more than 20 years ago.  In
order to obtain funding, we wrote grants, held numerous fundraisers and put
our blood, sweat and tears into restoring the majestic site we have all come
to love and cherish. People from all over the world enjoy the Lighthouse and
reminisce about their visit to Florida and the outstanding job we did
restoring the historic site. 

With this said, the Junior Service League is wholeheartedly committed to
seeing our Kids Bridge project through to fruition. We have done our
research before purchasing the property and house in which we are currently
renovating to house Kids Bridge.  Through our research, we made several
visits to other visitation centers in Florida, attended visitation center
workshops, and established an Advisory Board within our community which
consists of individuals from various organizations and corporations. This
Advisory Board is comprised of people from the judicial systems, victims
advocates, Guardian Ad Litem, Children's and Families, battered women's
shelter, law enforcement etc.  In addition, we also have support from
corporations such as Prosperity Bank, Bozard Ford, Florida East Coast,
BellSouth, Morgan Stanley, The Perdue Companies, Publix Super Markets, St.
Johns/ St. Augustine Chamber of Commerce etc. and organizations such as St.
Johns County Bar Association,  Rotary Club, and the list goes on.......These
people all have the same mission we do - to unify families and help them
"bridge the gap" that exists within these families.  

By approving the special appropriation of $100,000, you too can help us make
a difference in a child's life.  Since the future of Kids Bridge lies in
your hands, I ask that you carefully review this year's budget and consider
the impact you will have on the 200 families and hundreds of citizens that
are anxiously awaiting your reply.  After more than 4 years of researching,
planning and dreaming, please do not let this much-needed facility die
before it even has a chance to bloom.

Respectfully Yours,

Dear Governor Bush,

 My wife and I both served on committees of The South Walton Conservation
and Development Trust as we in Walton County tried to make Walton County a
different place that would reflect the unique and beautiful natural areas we
have been blessed to have as our home.
  We urge you to veto  bill 1053 that exempts certain billboards from local
control. The control of signage is vital to keeping Scenic US 98 and other
proposed scenic routes in Walton County from becoming just what the people
of our County  said they did not want.
  We also understand that certain of the larger counties and cities are
exempt from the requirements of the bill. this is an unwarranted  and unfair
exercise of political power.
   If this bill becomes law much of the $800,000.00 spent by the State to
help Walton County  develop a workable comprehensive plan will have been
negated to benefit  a specific special interest.
  Again we respectfully request that you veto this bill.

Dear Governor Bush:

Below are some reasons for vetoing this bad public policybill:

1. HB 1053 creates special property rights for billboards not enjoyed by
other personal property.
2. HB 1053 overturns years of decisions and planning by local governments
3. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of "carve-outs" for some
politically powerful areas.
4. HB 1053 is essentially an unfunded mandate that will increase the cost of
local government.
5. HB 1053 is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the
Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic beauty.
6. HB 1053's billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida
which include:
a. The Florida League of Cities
b. The Florida Association of Counties
c. The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs
d. 1000 Friends of Florida
e. American Planning Association Florida Chapter
f. Citizens for a Scenic Florida
g. Florida League of Conservation Voters
and
h. Over 20 major newspapers in Florida
7. HB 1053 serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too
many inappropriately placed billboards.
8. HB 1053 is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.  After all,
the ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected
councils and commissions.

Please veto this bill.  Florida has far too many unsightly bilboards!

preventing the abuse of children at very low cost to the State taxpayers. 
 I know that literally hundreds of local supporters of this program have

abuse last year at a cost of $190,000.00.  What will happen to the children 
needing this help next year if you veto this funding?

	Please keep this important program operational and continue to do what you

 How else will the state do this if not through prevention programs such as 
this?

Dear Governor Bush:
Please veto HB 1053 - the Billboard Bill. Florida municipalities have taken 
the time and effort to adopt billboard ordinances, and efforts to overturn 
their regulations are clearly in the wrong. Property rights should be 
respected, but local efforts enlist public input, so local regulations take 
into account the needs and desires of the residents of the municipality. The 
state needs to respect and honor the efforts, if knowledgeable and clearly 
in the best interest of the municipality, instead of overturning those 
efforts with weak state legislation. If state legislation is to be enacted, 
it must strongly oppose billboards or poor and excessive sighting of 
billboards.

I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, and I currently live in Vermont, due to 
a recent move from Florida. Vermont has banned billboards, and although that 
is a desirable choice, it may not be right for Florida. Florida is 
demographically, culturally, and climatically different from Vermont, but 
despite the differences, local municipalities should have the right to 
decide where, how, and why billboards are placed within their 
municipalities. I carry a deep love for Florida, and its natural beauty, in 
my eye, far surpasses the deep and brooding mountainous environment of New 
England. So many journey to Northern New England to "escape" the hustle and 
bustle of the cities and traffic enthroned areas of the country. Florida has 
been facing many challenges, many challenges presented themselves before the 
state was ready to deal with them, fostering the urban sprawl, wetland 
destruction, and traffic congestion. Florida has a great deal of potential 
to protect what it has, which is still so very much. I believe the eye can 
behold either the truths or the falsities that transcend a state's 
environment. As citizens and visitors traverse Florida's magnificient 
landscape, they may believe that the sight of incessant billboards and trash 
along the roadsides equates a compromised environment-- that possibly the 
state and local governments, along with citizens, do not value the natural 
wonders of the state, that they, the other citizens and visitors, are free 
to compromise the environment evermore. Although regulating billboards will 
not save Florida from development, it will add a much needed depth to the 
false perceptions of citizens and visitors -- that lawmakers do not truly 
care about Florida's environment.

Please stay true to your environmental campaign strategies and prove that 
you care about Florida's environmental future. Please VETO HB 1053 and make 
this step towards a cleaner Florida.

Thank you for your time,

Dear Governor:
 
This e-mail is written to voice my concern regarding Leon County needing leadership.  Governor, I thought about placing my name on the list of candidates seeking appointment to the recent vacancy for the seat on the Leon County Board of Commissioners but I did not want to be turned down.
 
You have several good names to chose from and I could support a few of these individuals for the replacement of this vacancy.  When considering the composition of the commissioners serving Leon County and the fact that Leon County is a government town I recognize the need for the experience and balance that would result from the appointment of Emanuel Joanos.  Please look at this man's experience and leadership for the replacement on the Leon County Commissioners Board.
 
Governor, I am closer to at least three other individuals seeking you appointment to the Board of Commissioners; however, I feel strongly that Emanuel Joanos would give Leon County the balance that it needs.
 
This is very important for Leon County as a community.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely,
DeVoe

Not only will this contribute to scenic blight it is highly questionable
public policy for the following reasons:
1.  It violates Republican principles of equal rights and grants special

2.  Overturns years of planning by local governments.
3.  Contrary to Article 11 Section 7 of the Florida Constitution

4.  Creates an unfunded mandate that will increase the cost of local

5.  Creates "carve outs" in politically strong areas, thus fostering

6.  Creates special property rights not enjoyed by other property owners.

FILE: Florida Information Loop for Education 

    This commentary about School To Work systems was written by journalist 
Bob Holland and was published in 1998. This was the same year the Heritage 
Foundation asked for immediate closure of School to Work initiatives 
nationwide. Congress turned a deaf ear to the conservative think tank 
(Heritage) for the most part, although a few of the more conservative 
Republicans listened and have attempted for several years to have Goals 2000 
and School to Work Acts repealed. 
    I highly recommend reading this article for a deeper understanding of 
the impact that School to Work has had on classroom curriculum and activities. 
    Please read on. (thanks to Billie in Ft Myers for this article)

Thank you for the reminder.  Proper nutrition and protection from the Sun's
harmful rays are always important.  But perhaps I wasn't clear about my
invitation to provide the Governor scientific data to support your position.
I was referring to the bill at issue addressing booster seats, not to the
dangers posed by heart disease or skin cancer to all age groups.  And since
you have presented no evidence that either danger has resulted in a single
death or injury to a child ages 5 through 9, neither are relevant to the
issue of this bill.

I take it from its glaring ommission in your lengthy response that you do
not contest the assertion that children should remain in booster seats if
they are 8 years of age or younger and under 4'9".  As you may know, this
standard is recommended by the National highway Traffic Safety
Administration, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the Center for Disease
Control, the Acadamy of Pediatrics, just to name a few.  Yes, even including
the Junior League.  According to a study by the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine, children who weigh under 80 lbs. and use automobile seat
belts are nearly four times more likely to receive serious injury in a
collision than kids in safety or booster seats.

Your references to skin cancer and nutrition do bring up a good point.
Unlike nutrition and skin care, the government has already intruded into the
"parent-child" relationship in the area of child safety seats. Current law
requires children under the age of 5 to ride in a child safety seat.  After
5, children must ride in seat belts, even through the seat belts do not fit
small children and in fact cause children injury and death.  This bill is
necessary because the current law causes injuries and deaths to children
because it misleads parents into believing that child safety seats,
including booster seats, are not necessary after the age of 5. In fact,
according to the Center for Disease Control, only 6% of children 4 - 8 years
of age use boosters seats. If you advocate veto of this bill, would you
recommend including in the veto message a call by the Governor to repeal
current child safety seat regulations?  The state should either enact safety
belt laws that protect children or step out altogether.

Your point that before government intervenes, or in this case expands its
current intervention, the benefit to be obtained must be measured, is well
taken. According to a 2/15/00 AP story, in 1998 alone 495 children ages 5 -
9 were killed and 86,000 were injured in automobile crashes.  In Florida, 21
children ages 5 - 9 were killed and 6,002 were injured in traffic accidents
in 1999.  24 children ages 5 - 9 were killed in traffic accidents in Florida
in 2000. Nationwide, traffic crashes are the leading cause of death among
children 6 - 14 years of age. 

You conclude that, "In sum, it seems that the high standard of justification
for government intervention in the parent-child relationship has not been
met in this instance."  Now that you have data regarding child safety seats,
as opposed to data about skin cancer and heart disease, perhaps you could
recalculate.

Thanks for the invitation to provide some scientific data to consider in
evaluating the appropriateness for government intervention in the
parent-child relationship.  

1:  Please see the attached link on a very deadly problem that negatively
harms children that I'm sure Hayden will agree requires immediate government
action.  http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nscpep/skin.htm  According to the
American Cancer Society, a combined total of more than 1 million new cases
of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas and an additional 51,400 new
cases of malignant melanoma will be diagnosed in 2001. In 2001 alone, skin
cancer will claim the lives of almost 9,800 people.  It hard to imagine an
activity more essential to life than "being outside."  I would even submit
that "being outside" is more essential to basic human existence than even
driving a car, i.e. before one can drive a car, by definition they must go
"outside."  One of the inherent risks of being outside is skin cancer.  This
year, almost 10,000 lives will be unnecessarily destroyed by this completely
preventable disease.  In the face of these tragic deaths, I'm sure Hayden
would agree that the government must step in and do something.  Since Hayden
strongly supports the mandatory purchase and use of booster seats for
children, I assume he would assume strongly support the mandatory purchase
of hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen for children as well.  The cost would be
roughly the same as the cost of a booster seat, and all state and local
government life guards would be empowered to issue violation tickets to any
parent they witness who have not properly applied sunscreen to their
children.  Thousands of lives could be saved by this simple law, right
Hayden?

2:  Here's another link on a deadly problem that I'm sure Hayden will agree
requires immediate government action.
http://www.americanheart.org/statistics/cvd.html  According to the American
Heart Association, heart disease claimed 949,619 lives in the United States
in 1998. More than 2,600 Americans die of heart disease each day, an average
of 1 death every 33 seconds.  Heart disease claims almost 10,500 more lives
each year than the next 6 leading causes of death combined.  Unfortunately,
too many parents neglect the proper nutritional needs of their children, and
feed them harmful amount of fatty and cholesterol-laden foods which lead to
heart disease later in life.  Why should a child have to suffer the
consequences of poor decisions made for him or her by thoughtless,
uninformed or undisciplined parents?  I'm sure Hayden would agree that a law
should be passed to save the lives of these helpless children by making it a
legal violation (with precisely the same penalties as failing to use a
booster seat) to feed children any food item where more than 1/3 of the
calories from that food item come from fat as determined by the FDA.  

There are those who may choose to mock the arguments regarding intrusiveness
and invasiveness when considering laws such as the booster seat law.
However, I would invite any such person to explain why government
intervention is not also necessary and desirable in the above two examples,
which cause substantially more death and family destruction than the lack of
booster seats for 6-8 year old children.  

The point isn't that government intervention is never necessary.  In some
cases, such intervention is in fact necessary.  However, because the cost of
intrusiveness is so high, a high burden of justification should be required
before any decision of the government to intervene is made.  No one, not
even Pamela Oviatt or any auto manufacturer expert witness can tell us how
many children were injured or were killed in Florida due to the lack of use
of a booster seat.   

The law proposes a costly and burdensome solution to a problem that no one
can quantify.  How can the cost and the burden of the law be measured
against the potential benefits when no one can tell us the extent of the
current problem?  In addition, even if we could quantify the problem, why
should one assume that government intervention and legislative mandate is
the sole and exclusive means of addressing the problem?  Have other methods
been attempted to address this problem that do not involve government
intervention?  

In sum, it seems that the high standard of justification for government
intervention in the parent-child relationship has not been met in this
instance.  If it has, I would then assume that the person making such an
assertion would also agree that the standard has also been met in the above
two examples.  

Let me know if you need further scientific data.

Dear Governor Bush:

	I am writing to you in support of the Hibiscus Crisis Nursery Program 
serving Martin, Indian River, St. Lucie and Okeechobee counties.  This is a 
primary prevention program that has proven to be highly effective in 
preventing the abuse of children at very low cost to the State taxpayers. 
 I know that literally hundreds of local supporters of this program have 
written to you asking that you NOT veto this important program, proving how 
important this project is to our community.  This community rallies around 
anything having to do with protection of children.  You too, have pledged 
support of these types of "community based"efforts.  While tax watch has 
recommended your veto of the funding for this program, I truly hope that 
you will consider that there were 1300 children this program kept free from 
abuse last year at a cost of $190,000.00.  What will happen to the children 
needing this help next year if you veto this funding?

	Please keep this important program operational and continue to do what you

Subject:	Please veto the bad billboard bill - HB 1053

Dear Governor Bush:

Below are some reasons for vetoing this bad public policybill:

1. HB 1053 creates special property rights for billboards not enjoyed by
other personal property.
2. HB 1053 overturns years of decisions and planning by local governments
3. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of "carve-outs" for some
politically powerful areas.
4. HB 1053 is essentially an unfunded mandate that will increase the cost of
local government.
5. HB 1053 is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the
Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic beauty.
6. HB 1053's billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida
which include:
a. The Florida League of Cities
b. The Florida Association of Counties
c. The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs
d. 1000 Friends of Florida
e. American Planning Association Florida Chapter
f. Citizens for a Scenic Florida
g. Florida League of Conservation Voters
and
h. Over 20 major newspapers in Florida
7. HB 1053 serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too
many inappropriately placed billboards.
8. HB 1053 is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.  After all,
the ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected
councils and commissions.

Please veto this bill.  Florida has far too many unsightly bilboards!

Subject:	Please VETO HB 1053 - Billboard Bill

Dear Governor Bush:
Please veto HB 1053 - the Billboard Bill. Florida municipalities have taken 
the time and effort to adopt billboard ordinances, and efforts to overturn 
their regulations are clearly in the wrong. Property rights should be 
respected, but local efforts enlist public input, so local regulations take 
into account the needs and desires of the residents of the municipality. The 
state needs to respect and honor the efforts, if knowledgeable and clearly 
in the best interest of the municipality, instead of overturning those 
efforts with weak state legislation. If state legislation is to be enacted, 
it must strongly oppose billboards or poor and excessive sighting of 
billboards.

I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, and I currently live in Vermont, due to 
a recent move from Florida. Vermont has banned billboards, and although that 
is a desirable choice, it may not be right for Florida. Florida is 
demographically, culturally, and climatically different from Vermont, but 
despite the differences, local municipalities should have the right to 
decide where, how, and why billboards are placed within their 
municipalities. I carry a deep love for Florida, and its natural beauty, in 
my eye, far surpasses the deep and brooding mountainous environment of New 
England. So many journey to Northern New England to "escape" the hustle and 
bustle of the cities and traffic enthroned areas of the country. Florida has 
been facing many challenges, many challenges presented themselves before the 
state was ready to deal with them, fostering the urban sprawl, wetland 
destruction, and traffic congestion. Florida has a great deal of potential 
to protect what it has, which is still so very much. I believe the eye can 
behold either the truths or the falsities that transcend a state's 
environment. As citizens and visitors traverse Florida's magnificient 
landscape, they may believe that the sight of incessant billboards and trash 
along the roadsides equates a compromised environment-- that possibly the 
state and local governments, along with citizens, do not value the natural 
wonders of the state, that they, the other citizens and visitors, are free 
to compromise the environment evermore. Although regulating billboards will 
not save Florida from development, it will add a much needed depth to the 
false perceptions of citizens and visitors -- that lawmakers do not truly 
care about Florida's environment.

Please stay true to your environmental campaign strategies and prove that 
you care about Florida's environmental future. Please VETO HB 1053 and make 
this step towards a cleaner Florida.

Subject:	FLORIDA RECEIVES ADDITIONAL $32 MILLION IN MEDICAID FUNDING

TALLAHASSEE--Florida will receive an additional $32 million 
in Medicaid funds this year after receiving approval by the 
federal government for four more program waivers requested 
last year by Governor Bush.  U.S. Health and Human Services 
Secretary Tommy Thompson notified Florida officials of the 
approvals for the following programs:

*	Healthy Start program-This will expand Medicaid benefits 
for a full range of Healthy Start Services for 60,000 
pregnant women and add more people to the program, earning 
Florida an additional $13 million annually.

*	Subacute Inpatient Psychiatric Care Program-This 
additional $13 million will give Medicaid coverage for 
almost 1,200 children in private psychiatric facilities and 
residential treatment facilities.

*	Medicaid transportation services-This $6 million will 
allow Medicaid to retain a higher federal matching rate for 
services that affect 145,000 people.

*	Children's Medical Services (CMS) Network-Increased 
flexibility will allow the Department of Health and its 
providers to tailor Medicaid services to the individual 
needs of CMS eligibles, estimated at 20,000.


"We have cut through years of red tape to deliver these 
important services to our most vulnerable and needy 
citizens," said Governor Jeb Bush. "I want to thank the 
Florida Congressional delegation and our state legislature 
for the successful team effort initiated at the 
federal/state summit."

Previously, Florida had received approval for three other 
Medicaid programs that added $159 million annually to the 
Medicaid budget.

"Since Florida stands at 7 for 7 in Medicaid approvals, 
this is a grand slam for Florida and our residents," said 
Congressman Clay Shaw (R-22nd), chairman of Florida's 
Congressional delegation.

Congressman Mike Bilirakis (R-9th), who chairs the Health 
Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 
added, "Secretary Thompson is obviously a man of his word," 
he said.  "He promised new flexibilities and a new tone at 
the Health Care Financing Administration and he has 
delivered on behalf of all Floridians."
		
"Today's results are impressive with over 225,000 
individuals gaining access to these critical health care 
services," said Congresswoman Karen Thurman (D-5th), chair 
of the Health and Human Services panel at the federal/state 
summit held in Tallahassee in March.  "I was proud to 
facilitate this summit priority and am pleased to see it 
concluded with these new opportunities for children and 
pregnant women."

Subject:	Appointment to Board of Trustees - Florida Gulf Coast University

Dear Honorable Governor Bush and Lt. Governor Brogan, 

I am a nominee for a position on the Florida Gulf Coast University Board of 
Trustees and wanted to contact you to convey how eager I am to serve you and 
the Florida educational system in this capacity.  As you may recall, Alex 
Sanchez of the Florida Bankers Association met with you last week regarding 
my appointment to further emphasize my qualifications, as well as my 
commitment to education.  I truly believe that education is the key to our 
future and I would delight in the opportunity to contribute and serve in the 
Florida Educational system as a member of the Florida Gulf Coast University 
Board of Trustees.  As I am sure Alex conveyed to you, the banking community 
is committed to deeper involvement in the community, and as a Private Banker 
at AmSouth Bank, this is my goal as well.  In addition to my role as Private 
Banker, I also serve as our Community Reinvestment Act liaison to the 
community.  It is my mission to ensure that AmSouth Bank helps meet the 
credit needs of the Lee/Collier/Charlotte County communities, including low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods and minority owned businesses.  This 
mission is certainly in harmony with that of the University and the Small 
Business Administration division administered by Dan Rigalski at FGCU.   

I realize the Lt. Governor is playing an integral role in this crucial 
selection process.  Through my work with the "Uncommon Friends" foundation, I 
have had the opportunity to meet and get to know Frank, and I am truly 
thrilled with his involvement in this selection process and applaud his 
commitment to education.   

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Alex Sanchez to discuss my 
qualifications, and for your kind consideration of my nomination.  I am 
keenly aware of the many qualified nominations which have poured into your 
office for positions on the Board of Trustees.  However, I believe that what 
sets me apart from the other FGCU Board nominees is not the fact that I am 
the only nominee who is a graduate of FGCU, but that I am passionate about 
education, and have a demonstrated dedication to education.

Dear Mr. Rose,
Thank you for your patience regarding Mr. Washington.  I received the background information I mentioned a few weeks ago on Mr. Washington today, so I am better able to respond to your requests.  Although the evidence against Mr. Washington appears substantial, you could encourage him to send an application for a waiver of the Rules of Executive Clemency and an application for Executive Clemency to The Office of Executive Clemency, 2601 Blairstone Road, Tallahassee, FL 32399.  After sending in these applications and if Mr. Washington receives sufficient support from the Clemency Board (i.e., the Governor and Cabinet), the Parole Commission will conduct an investigation into the circumstances of his conviction.  You may request these application forms by calling the Office of Executive Clemency at (850) 488-2952.
 
To be fair, you should know that very few inmates are freed from prison by the Clemency Board.  In my opinion, Mr. Washington's chances are not particularly strong.  The information I received showed that his fingerprints were found at the murder scene.  Nonetheless, Mr. Washington is free to seek a commutation of his sentence from the Clemency Board and this office will fully review any evidence submitted that tends to disprove his guilt.
 
According to Gulf Correctional Institute, you can arrange a visit with Mr. Washington by obtaining a visitation application from Mr. Washington and submitting it to the Central Visitation Authority.  The address of the authority is on the application.  You can also request a visit using a toll-free number (877-822-1987) (or call 850-487-8134 in Tallahassee), but I understand it is very difficult to get through on this number.
 
I understand that it must be difficult to have a former student insisting upon his innocence, and I appreciate your desire to see that justice is served.  I share that desire and I will assist you as much as is permissible if Mr. Washington submits an application for clemency.  Thank you for contacting the Governor's Office.
 
Sincerely,
Greg Munson

June 12, 2001


Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to you to request that you support Kids Bridge Supervised
Family Visitation Center that is currently being considered as part of your
budget. As President of the Junior Service League of St. Augustine, I have
been greatly involved with this project and am excited about our partnership
with Children's Home Society who will be assisting us with the day-to-day
operations.  I know that you have many other agencies and projects on your
list requesting approval and that you may thinking that this is just another
visitation center, but our center and endeavors to get it open are quite
unique.  Please allow me to explain..............

Four years ago, Honorable Robert Mathis and Honorable John Alexander saw a
need for such a facility in St. John's County, and knew exactly where to
turn for help in establishing such a facility.  Through our commitment and
dedication to the community of St. Johns County, we were able to completely
restore the St. Augustine Lightkeeper's House which is now the St. Augustine
Lighthouse & Museum when it burned to the ground more than 20 years ago.  In
order to obtain funding, we wrote grants, held numerous fundraisers and put
our blood, sweat and tears into restoring the majestic site we have all come
to love and cherish. People from all over the world enjoy the Lighthouse and
reminisce about their visit to Florida and the outstanding job we did
restoring the historic site. 

With this said, the Junior Service League is wholeheartedly committed to
seeing our Kids Bridge project through to fruition. We have done our
research before purchasing the property and house in which we are currently
renovating to house Kids Bridge.  Through our research, we made several
visits to other visitation centers in Florida, attended visitation center
workshops, and established an Advisory Board within our community which
consists of individuals from various organizations and corporations. This
Advisory Board is comprised of people from the judicial systems, victims
advocates, Guardian Ad Litem, Children's and Families, battered women's
shelter, law enforcement etc.  In addition, we also have support from
corporations such as Prosperity Bank, Bozard Ford, Florida East Coast,
BellSouth, Morgan Stanley, The Perdue Companies, Publix Super Markets, St.
Johns/ St. Augustine Chamber of Commerce etc. and organizations such as St.
Johns County Bar Association,  Rotary Club, and the list goes on.......These
people all have the same mission we do - to unify families and help them
"bridge the gap" that exists within these families.  

By approving the special appropriation of $100,000, you too can help us make
a difference in a child's life.  Since the future of Kids Bridge lies in
your hands, I ask that you carefully review this year's budget and consider
the impact you will have on the 200 families and hundreds of citizens that
are anxiously awaiting your reply.  After more than 4 years of researching,
planning and dreaming, please do not let this much-needed facility die
before it even has a chance to bloom.

Respectfully Yours,

Subject:	RE: CPS_Week.pdf

Thanks for the invitation to provide some scientific data to consider in evaluating the appropriateness for government intervention in the parent-child relationship.  

1:  Please see the attached link on a very deadly problem that negatively harms children that I'm sure Hayden will agree requires immediate government action.  http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nscpep/skin.htm  According to the American Cancer Society, a combined total of more than 1 million new cases of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas and an additional 51,400 new cases of malignant melanoma will be diagnosed in 2001. In 2001 alone, skin cancer will claim the lives of almost 9,800 people.  It hard to imagine an activity more essential to life than "being outside."  I would even submit that "being outside" is more essential to basic human existence than even driving a car, i.e. before one can drive a car, by definition they must go "outside."  One of the inherent risks of being outside is skin cancer.  This year, almost 10,000 lives will be unnecessarily destroyed by this completely preventable disease.  In the face of these tragic deaths, I'm sure Hayden would agree that the government must step in and do something.  Since Hayden strongly supports the mandatory purchase and use of booster seats for children, I assume he would assume strongly support the mandatory purchase of hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen for children as well.  The cost would be roughly the same as the cost of a booster seat, and all state and local government life guards would be empowered to issue violation tickets to any parent they witness who have not properly applied sunscreen to their children.  Thousands of lives could be saved by this simple law, right Hayden?

2:  Here's another link on a deadly problem that I'm sure Hayden will agree requires immediate government action.  http://www.americanheart.org/statistics/cvd.html  According to the American Heart Association, heart disease claimed 949,619 lives in the United States in 1998. More than 2,600 Americans die of heart disease each day, an average of 1 death every 33 seconds.  Heart disease claims almost 10,500 more lives each year than the next 6 leading causes of death combined.  Unfortunately, too many parents neglect the proper nutritional needs of their children, and feed them harmful amount of fatty and cholesterol-laden foods which lead to heart disease later in life.  Why should a child have to suffer the consequences of poor decisions made for him or her by thoughtless, uninformed or undisciplined parents?  I'm sure Hayden would agree that a law should be passed to save the lives of these helpless children by making it a legal violation (with precisely the same penalties as failing to use a booster seat) to feed children any food item where more than 1/3 of the calories from that food item come from fat as determined by the FDA.  

There are those who may choose to mock the arguments regarding intrusiveness and invasiveness when considering laws such as the booster seat law.  However, I would invite any such person to explain why government intervention is not also necessary and desirable in the above two examples, which cause substantially more death and family destruction than the lack of booster seats for 6-8 year old children.  

The point isn't that government intervention is never necessary.  In some cases, such intervention is in fact necessary.  However, because the cost of intrusiveness is so high, a high burden of justification should be required before any decision of the government to intervene is made.  No one, not even Pamela Oviatt or any auto manufacturer expert witness can tell us how many children were injured or were killed in Florida due to the lack of use of a booster seat.   

The law proposes a costly and burdensome solution to a problem that no one can quantify.  How can the cost and the burden of the law be measured against the potential benefits when no one can tell us the extent of the current problem?  In addition, even if we could quantify the problem, why should one assume that government intervention and legislative mandate is the sole and exclusive means of addressing the problem?  Have other methods been attempted to address this problem that do not involve government intervention?  

In sum, it seems that the high standard of justification for government intervention in the parent-child relationship has not been met in this instance.  If it has, I would then assume that the person making such an assertion would also agree that the standard has also been met in the above two examples.  

Let me know if you need further scientific data.

According to the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) data attached, "Each year, 1,700 children die and almost 300,000 are injured in motor vehicle crashes. Six out of tem children killed in crashes are completely unrestrained." (The report does not say the ages of these children.)  NHTSA recommends booster seats for all children below 4'9" tall and 80 lbs.

I'm sure Brian and Justin will be forwarding you scientific data to support their position shortly.

Subject:	Item 2367A-Car Control Clinic Pilot Test

Dear Governor Bush, 


Senator Ron Klein, Rep. Irving Slosberg and the Palm Beach Delegation have introduced a budget item called Car Control Clinic Pilot Test. This is based on a unique, hands-on, in-car training program for new drivers and their parents that helps them avoid accidents and drive defensively. It is intensive training with the kids behind the wheel having mock crashes/emergencies in cone patterns. The pilot test would be conducted in several Florida cities. 


As you know, Florida does not fund or require driver education in order to have a license. What it does do, because of the efforts of Don Marksz, many legislators and you, is require parents to spend a year (or at least 50 hours) in the car with the child before a full license is issued. 


The problem is no one--not the state, industry, school system--no one teaches the parent what and how to teach the child. We do that. Because in our New Driver Car Control Clinics we don't accept a child without a parent. Both leave with a clear plan and new understandings. 


Through the urging of parents and teens who have experienced our program, the legislators and the National Safety Council examined it and they and their colleagues want to see if we can do this for every parent and new driver in Florida. That is why they have included the Car Control Clinic Pilot Test item on line 2367A of the General Appropriations Act of 2001. 


I urge you not only to keep this item in the budget, but to encourage the appropriate state government agencies to give their support as well. Florida is doing very little to produce better drivers. (law enforcement and court-ordered traffic violator schools do not replace training) Effective driver training could. 


And you should know that we do not see this as solely the responsibility of the State. These funds will be treated as seed money and we and the legislators will aggressively seek funding from industry sources and we will ask parents to pay their fair share as well. And finally, HB 1687, allowing counties to surcharge traffic tickets, may be an excellent source of future funding should the pilot test produce the positive results we expect. 


Thank you for your consideration and good luck in your deliberations over the budget. 


Sincerely,

Techniques for Teen Drivers. I feel this was a very valuable learning 
experience for her. She was taught defensive driving skills and experienced 
driving situations and was taught how to deal with them safely.

 I believe all NEW drivers should have this learning experience. I believe it 
would make this next generation of drivers safer, and more responsible behind 
the wheel of a car, therefore, safer towards you, I and our families as they 
driver Florida's busy streets and highways.

There is a budget item that requires your consideration and hopefully your 
VETO. That is Budget Item 2367 A-Car Control Clinic Pilot Test. Please 
consider supporting this very valuable program.

Thank you in advance.

We urge you to veto Billboard Legislation HB 1053.  It is bad legislation for the Citizens of Florida and can be expected to have political repercussions next year.  To assure that our opposition is promptly known, we are also sending a Fax.

Dear Govenor Bush;

There are several worthwhile projects on your desk for approval for Martin
County.  The people of  Martin County as you will see when you visit care
deeply for the children in our community.  We strive to make this a safe and
healthy place for them to grow up in.  Support our efforts to provide them
with safe and healthy environments in which to live and play by approving
our requests for the Hibiscus House prenatal program, the Skate Park in
Jensen Beach,  the River Initiative and the Oceanographic Society expansion.
Help us make this a great place for our children.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Larry Austin for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

i feel the highway patrol should not have the same mind set as the days of the 1970. but should consider the age and opportunities of those who are not binded by the degree of color. not that color or gender should be a factor, but in the last fifty plus years that has been our mind set. let's not make the highway patrol a color thing or a gender thing, but if we do not change the way we select people for higher office, it will simply be a gender and a color thing. that is why my selection is for Chief Larry Austin or Major Rebecca Tharpe. IMAGE IS NOT EVERYTHING WHEN PEOPLE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE DO THE JOB,SAFETY, AND VALUE ON THEIR OWN HUMAN LIVES.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TUESDAY, JUNE 12, 2001
(850) 488-5394


FLORIDA RECEIVES ADDITIONAL $32 MILLION
IN MEDICAID FUNDING

	TALLAHASSEE--Florida will receive an additional $32 million in
Medicaid funds this year after receiving approval by the federal government
for four more program waivers requested last year by Governor Bush.  U.S.
Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson notified Florida
officials of the approvals for the following programs:

	*	Healthy Start program-This will expand Medicaid benefits for
a full range of Healthy Start Services for 60,000 pregnant women and add
more people to the program, earning Florida an additional $13 million
annually.
	*	Subacute Inpatient Psychiatric Care Program-This additional
$13 million will give Medicaid coverage for almost 1,200 children in private
psychiatric facilities and residential treatment facilities.
	*	Medicaid transportation services-This $6 million will allow
Medicaid to retain a higher federal matching rate for services that affect
145,000 people.
	*	Children's Medical Services (CMS) Network-Increased
flexibility will allow the Department of Health and its providers to tailor
Medicaid services to the individual needs of CMS eligibles, estimated at
20,000.

	"We have cut through years of red tape to deliver these important
services to our most vulnerable and needy citizens," said Governor Jeb Bush.
"I want to thank the Florida Congressional delegation and our state
legislature for the successful team effort initiated at the federal/state
summit."

	Previously, Florida had received approval for three other Medicaid
programs that added $159 million annually to the Medicaid budget.

	"Since Florida stands at 7 for 7 in Medicaid approvals, this is a
grand slam for Florida and our residents," said Congressman Clay Shaw
(R-22nd), chairman of Florida's Congressional delegation.

		Congressman Mike Bilirakis (R-9th), who chairs the Health
Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, added, "Secretary
Thompson is obviously a man of his 

	(more)
	MEDICAID FUNDING - Page Two

	word," he said.  "He promised new flexibilities and a new tone at
the Health Care Financing Administration and he has delivered on behalf of
all Floridians."
		
	"Today's results are impressive with over 225,000 individuals
gaining access to these critical health care services," said Congresswoman
Karen Thurman (D-5th), chair of the Health and Human Services panel at the
federal/state summit held in Tallahassee in March.  "I was proud to
facilitate this summit priority and am pleased to see it concluded with
these new opportunities for children and pregnant women."

AEA will be releasing their annual stats on the top cyberstates in the
US---while they would not provide me with details, the EX Dir. did state
that Florida has improved dramatically and will be in the top five states.
They are interested in a press event with you and the mayors of the cities
that improved the most.
I will contact your staff to discuss your interest and availability.

Hi Julia,
The actual data will be released on June 6 at a press conference with
national
media at our Washington office.  The conference is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
We
can do something anytime after that initial release.  I am in Ft. Lauderdale
on
the 6th and 7th.  We don't necessarily need to do it on the same date -
might be
better if we wait and coordinate this with something else (and I don't know
what
that might be) that is of related interest and has the Governor's support or
interest.   The ideal would be to have all six mayors of the major high tech
cities - Orlando, Tampa, Melbourne, West Palm, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami for
a
press conference in Tallahassee.  Is there a Mayor's meeting any time soon
that
would have them up there?

As I said - I am open to anything and believe that this is a major deal for
Florida.  Upside Magazine will be doing a spread (we hope it is the cover
spread) for their September issue on the top five states.  Florida, of
course,
will be one of the five featured in the story.  Also, from last year, we
know
that there will be a press spotlight on the states that are in the top five.

I will have my copy of Cyberstates this week.  I can make arrangements to
have
it in the Governor's hands on June 6 at 8:30 a.m.  We are not able to
provide it
before - don't want it in reporters' hands by accident. We are releasing it
to
several media sources in Florida prior to the release with the strict
understanding that the data is embargoed until June 6.

Thanks for your offer to help - I gratefully accept and will follow whatever
suggestions/advice/direction you offer.

I understand that Margie Menduni has submitted her name to you in consideration for County Commissioner to fill Rudy Maloy's vacancy.  It is my privilege to be writing you to express my support for Margie.  I have known Margie for approximately seven years and have worked with her at the same law firm where I am a legal assistant.  I have found Margie to be a woman of impeccable integrity and honor with ethical and moral principals of the highest order.

I feel honored to be able to call Margie my friend, and in friendship find her to be kind, compassionate, and loyal.  I believe Margie possesses the qualities which will enable her to serve Leon County and Florida's community well.

I am proud to know Margie Menduni and feel confident that given the opportunity to come to know her, you would share my high opinion of this fine woman.

Please consider Margie in appointing a new County Commissioner.

Dear Governor Bush: 

As I'm sure you will recall, the Keys lost over $5 million in funding for wastewater/storm water projects at the 11th hour of the budget conference.

The remaining appropriations for my district are crucial.  The projects all serve public purpose.  Many projects listed in  TaxWatch have been funded by the state for years and do serve a public purpose.  

I ask that you please spare us the veto pen on our remaining funding. 

Sincerely,

Dear Govenor Bush;

There are several worthwhile projects on your desk for approval for Martin
County.  The people of  Martin County as you will see when you visit care
deeply for the children in our community.  We strive to make this a safe and
healthy place for them to grow up in.  Support our efforts to provide them
with safe and healthy environments in which to live and play by approving
our requests for the Hibiscus House prenatal program, the Skate Park in
Jensen Beach,  the River Initiative and the Oceanographic Society expansion.
Help us make this a great place for our children.

The first item is the top priority for Rep Johnson and, actually, is a decent project.  It is already creating jobs there and serves much more than sports (e.g., sports medicine and educational preparation related to health/sports).  
 
The second item I do not support nor does the Florida Sports Foundation.

Dear Gov. Bush: 

      I'm sure you are innudated with letters, e-mails and calls related to 
the budget. 
From the 2012 perspective, there are two items of strategic importance in the 
budget that also are good economic generators, in our opinion.  John Sykes 
and I identified these to you in our briefing last October. 

      The first is the $900,000 for the USA National Training Center in 
Clermont.  This is a super, private sector lead sports, medicine, and 
education complex in Clermont that really is cutting edge on many fronts.   
Winter home of British National Olympic Committee. 
       
      The second is $700,000 for the conversion of the Plant City Stadium to 
the International Softball Federation global headquarters, internationa 
softball hall of fame and softball complex.  Plant City and Hillsborough 
County have put in $2.2 million.  The $700,000 will complete this phase by 
converting the former Red's practice fields into competition fields.  Timing 
is critical.  Plant City and Tampa Bay area is hosting the Junior World Cup 
of Softball this Thanksgiving - over 30 nations participating - and the World 
Congress of Softball, over 120 nations attending.  These are things we landed 
early this year.  Most of USOC top leaders will be here, plus good chance of 
new IOC president in likely only visit to the US before Oct. 2002!  Next year 
will the the University World Championship Games plus dozens of national and 
regional tournaments.  These are great heads and beds events since each team 
brings minimum of 20 guests and stay at least seven days.  Plus, 
unprecedented opportunity for international tourism since this is the 
international federation for the sport that sanctions all events.  All this 
is wonderful from the perspective of securing support for our bid nationally 
and internationally at the right level. 

      Both projects meet our test for support before we approach you or the 
legislature about supporting.  Our test is that a project must:  1) have 
present day economic value; 2) have strategic value in terms of winning the 
competition for the bid; 3) be directly related to the Olympic Games plan; 
and 4) have significant private and/or local level financial support.   

      Thank you for your consideration. 


This is Florida's first National Governing Body of Sport and a tremendous new 
asset that

Swales Expands with Florida Office -- Maryland-based Swales Aerospace, a provider of satellites, associated flight hardware, and space-related engineering services, has opened an office in Florida to support NASA operations at the Cape Canaveral Spaceport and to compete for new government and commercial contracts.  In addition to its new office in Merritt Island, Swales operates facilities in Maryland, Virginia and California.  Visit Swales at www.swales.com.
 
RTI Wins FAA Contract for Commercial Launch Support -- The Cocoa Beach office of Research Triangle Institute (RTI) will support a $25 million, 5-year contract with the FAA to address public safety issues associated with commercial space launches and re-entry operations of reusable launch vehicles, according to the Brevard Technical Journal.  RTI’s Florida office is widely recognized as a world leader in space transportation risk and safety analysis.  RTI also supports similar contracts with NASA and the Air Force.
 
SGS and Sverdrup Support Summer Teacher Employment -- In addition to the companies listed in my previous spacegram that have hired teachers for summer jobs under the SIFT program, Space Gateway Support and Sverdrup have hired 10 teachers to work in their space-related businesses over the summer of 2001.  Visit www.sift.org for information.
 
New Atlas and Delta Rockets Arrive for Pathfinder Tests -- In preparation for their first launches next year, Boeing and Lockheed Martin have both shipped their first Delta IV and Atlas V rockets to the Cape Canaveral Spaceport for a series of “pathfinder” tests to validate shipping, handling, and processing procedures for the next-generation expendable launch vehicle systems.
 
Committee Promotes Weldon Candidacy -- According to Florida Today, Florida Congressman Dave Weldon, whose district includes the Cape Canaveral Spaceport, has not yet decided whether he will seek re-election in 2002.  Weldon, who serves as vice chairman of the House Space & Aeronautics Subcommittee, had previously planned to serve only four terms.  A grass-roots committee has been formed to petition for Weldon to seek re-election.
 
X-43A California-Based Test Fails, Delays Pegasus Launch from Florida -- NASA’s X-43A hypersonic test vehicle failed during its first attempted launch on June 2 from under the wing of a B-52 carrier aircraft, according to SpaceRef.com.  The failure appeared to be related to the Pegasus winged launch vehicle to which the X-43A was attached.  Consequently, a NASA Pegasus launch scheduled for June 7 has been delayed until investigators determine the X-43A failure’s cause.
 
Former Floridians Get Top DOD Jobs -- President Bush has selected two former Floridians for important Defense Department positions, according to Florida Today.  Michael Wynne, a former Atlas launch vehicle executive will serve as deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology.  Dionel Aviles, a graduate of Satellite High School, will serve as assistant secretary of the Navy for financial management.
 
Harris Wins Satellite Radio Contract -- Melbourne-based Harris Corp. has been awarded a $300 million military multi-band satellite radio contract.  According to Florida Today, Harris has won three recent major military satellite radio contracts.

USA Labor Strike Averted -- According to Florida Today, workers and management at United Space Alliance (USA) reached an agreement last week to avert strike by more than 600 shuttle workers in the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The strike threat came a few months after NASA's safety advisory panel warned against cuts in the shuttle workforce, fearing that launch safety could be reduced.

Dear Governor Bush, 
   I sincerely hope that you will veto the "Billboard" bill.  This bill 
removes control from the local governments.  The local citizens, who must 
view these billboards day after day, are truly the ones who should make 
the decisions.  Personally, I think billboards are terribly unsightly in 
urban as well as in rural areas. 
   Recently, the Orlando/Orange County local government negotiated a 
settlement regarding local billboards:  I believe it was a 10 year phase 
out with payments to the owners of the billboards to recompense them for 
their lost advertising.  My understanding is that this settlement will be 
thrown out unless you veto Bill 1053.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
    I hope you will recall the letter I sent you recently regarding our Florida adoption (current) and our thoughts on House Bill 141.  Thank you for your very kind response.
 
    I have never begged for help - certainly I have never had the "audacity" or perhaps just the gumption to request assistance from an elected official...but our baby and this adoption are so important to my husband and to myself, that I thought I would take the chance.
 
    You already know the story of the appearance of our "johnny come lately" birthfather - NOW that story is being complicated by the birth mother..
 
    We only "met" our birthmother on 1/2/01 - and our plans to adopt her baby were all made within 1-2 weeks of that first contact...Our baby was born on 1/31/01, which did not give us all much time to iron out very many "details."  HOWEVER, one thing that was discussed was the birthmother's expenses - not in specific terms, but in basic terms.  In NY a birthmother is allowed  3 months of expenses - 2 months before the baby's birth, one month after, or three months total before the baby's birth. These expenses must be approved by the court.  It seems that in Florida, things are a little different...although I do not know exactly "how" or "why."  
 
    Our birthmother told us initially that she did not want "anything" for expenses, because she did not want to feel as though she was "selling" her baby.  Our attorney told us to put some money into escrow for her and said that $3000 was a "reasonable and customary" amount.  We told our birthmother this, and she said that "she didn't want the money," and added that she would probably "tell the attorney to give the money back to you to use for the baby."  We told her that the money was hers, and it would be in escrow for her whenever she needed it.. and she agreed to that arrangement.
 
    Our attorney repeatedly asked her for an "expense account" of her monthly bills, but she never sent it to her...until last Friday.  THEN, our attorney received a laundry list of "expenses."  They included child care for her other two children (who only live with her part time), school supplies, money for a phone bill - when she did not have a phone until 2 weeks ago!!! - and other "miscellaneous" charges, including her credit card bill of $135.00 per month.  Her total monthly "expenses" added up to close to or over $2000 per month... which means that she is asking for approximately $12,000 in birthmother expenses.  Her excuse?  She was a waitress and believes she lost her job when she started to look too pregnant...
 
    She has also told our attorney (the agency attorney) that she is engaging the services of her own attorney - so that he can "help" her "get her money" and she expects us to pay his retainer ($2000) on her behalf.  She is saying that she we never really discussed an amount...and that she "heard" from either ME or one of her friends that she is "entitled" to six months of expenses by Florida law...I know that I never told her that, and her friend said she never did either. 
 
     Mr. Bush, to me this is extortion.  She has gone from wanting "nothing" to $12,000 in three month 's time...She knows we love our son, and do not want to lose him - to her OR to the birth father...she knows we will do anything to ensure that our baby remains with us...She knows that she agreed to $3000, that is why that amount was placed in escrow..Her request is NOT reasonable or customary - I am not arguing that our birthmother deserves to have expenses paid - but as I said, these, to my husband and myself, are not reasonable or customary - nor were they requested in a timely manner.  How could someone who claimed they did not want to feel as though they were "selling" their baby wait three months to ask for money, and then "throw out" a figure such as this?  Is this another "nuance" of Florida adoption laws that make adoption in Florida so
questionable??? 
   
    We came to Florida to adopt our baby with faith, love and trust in our hearts.  Our faith and our trust have been severely shaken - the only thing we really have left is our love for our little boy...a shining star in our lives.  
 
    I do not know how you can help us - I only know I needed for you to know the "rest" of our story...and I ned to know if there is anything that can be done?  is there anything in Florida adoption law, or other law, to protect us?  or is it really "adoptive parents beware" when it comes to a Florida adoption???
 
    Thank you for your time and understanding - 
 
   A very happy and blessed Easter to you and to your family - 
 
                                    Sincerely,

the decisions.  Personally, I think billboards are terribly unsightly in
urban as well as in rural areas.
	Recently, the Orlando/Orange County local government negotiated a
settlement regarding local billboards:  I believe it was a 10 year phase
out with payments to the owners of the billboards to recompense them for
their lost advertising.  My understanding is that this settlement will be
thrown out unless you veto Bill 1053.
	As president of a small business, I am very mindful of the power of
advertising.  However,  there should be balance between the owners of the
billboards, the wishes of the local population regarding the visual
blight caused by billboards, and the image Florida presents to our
visitors from around the country and around the world.
Sincerely,
Cynthia M. Collins

Governor,

	The 3 ships seized in the Miami River recently (Etoile De Mer,
Miguana, and Tacoma) are moving toward a sinking later this summer, most
likely for a reef off  Key Biscayn).   Titles have been transferred, dockage
fees waived or settled, and cleaning proceeding.  Marilyn Culp has
identified youth groups invovled in the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug
Free Community to "adopt" the ships.  Money from salvage parts will go
towards reimbursement of clean up operations, with remaining money split
between Customs and a special fund (most likely County or multi-Country) to
handle future operations such as these.

	We will be sure to create the proper public event (with youth
invovlement) around the actual sinkings.

	Elsewhere, we continue to make seizures related to Operation
Riverwalk.  The seizures are getting smaller (as the smugglers hedge their
bets) and they continue to divert from the Miami area (which we see as a
good outcome and one that we continue to capitalize on as we seize them
elsewhere).

	I am staying in close touch with the prosecutors as we move forward
in this operation.  Guy Lewis has some promising leads.

	I will be going after more HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking
Area) money to sustain the operations.  The money comes from the Office of
National Drug Control Policy; once McCaffrey left in early January, those
managing the money there got tight or was diverted, so some of the expected
money dried up.  Kathleen is helping on this, so I'm optimistic we'll get
it.

	Bottom line, we're moving ahead on Riverwalk and the ship sinkings
with good prevention involement from youth in Miami.

needs of the patients and physicians of the State of

September.  Knowing that your schedule constantly

give us a firm answer at this time.

opportunity to express face to face our gratitude for
your decision to sign the "All Products" Bill.

Governor, 

You asked me why you did not recognize any of the names of the recommended
investment products.  The reason is that the investment products that are
being reviewed here are institutional products.  You are more familiar with
retail products. Retail products generally have higher fees.  In September,
you will evaluate these institutional products against the products offered
by the bundled providers such as Vanguard, with products of their own, and
Valic, who will provide retail products such as Scudder Growth and Income or
Templeton Foreign Fund.

In order to create a "fund" (Fasano would say SBA Mutual Fund) for the U.S.
Small Stock Active Fund, the SBA is proposing the following configuration. 

SMall Cap Broad - 45%		Battery March Financial Management
Small Cap Growth - 25%		Columbia Management Company
Small Cap Value  - 25%		Ark Asset Management
Index (5% for liquidity) 		

Under the Small Cap Broad product search, two institutional products that
have a common name and were considered (made the top four) were Fidelity and
T. Rowe Price.  Performance was the key.  

For instance.  The four top Small Cap Broad performers were 

Batterymarch Financial Managment   14.79% performance annualized over 5
years  fees are 72 basis points  
Fidelity Managment Trust Company      7.79%  "                     "
"     "   "   fees are 63 basis points
T. Rowe Price Associates                   5.75%    "		      "
62
Wellington                                        11.62%
70
(By the way - Wellington already has a good chunk of SBA/DB dollars for
investment.)

Batterymarch Financial Management scored highest.  Highest annualized return
even after fees.

The four top Small Cap Growth Performers were

Columbia (FleetBoston Subsidiary)    14.2% with fees at 68
HLM Management Company	        9.9% with fees at 75
Mazama                                          11.0% with fees at 70
Westwood Management Co.	       11.2% with fees at 75

Columbia scored the highest.  Highest annualized return even after fees.

The four top Small Cap Value Performers were

Ark					6.18%  with fees of 68
Boston Company			5.86%  with fees of 90 (only four year
existence vs. five)
Investment Counselors of Maryland	2.92% with fees of 69
Schroder				4.85% with fees of 100

Ark Asset Management scored highest.  However, you should know that there is
a story of Ark being fired by the Illinois Teachers Fund.  The termination
was due to value investing disappointment and the manner in which the fund
was sold.  (Callen, the consultants believe that there isn't a problem.

Specifically, we need help with the following: 
     1) 500 citizens (including more than the 20% required of registered 
voters) signed a petition which has been sent to the Joint Committee on 
Auditing requesting the Auditor General do a complete financial and 
operational audit of our city's finance department- we need this done as 
quickly as possible as there may be steps being taken to distroy records that 
may be needed during this audit. 
      2) Our city manager has a history of lying to the public which has 
destroyed public confidence in our local government. Appearances of collusion 
and conducting business outside of the sunshine are evident constantly among 
the manager and four of the five commissioners. 
      3)  Several thousands of dollars in utility payments are missing and 
an in-house police investigation has not come to a conclusion after nearly a 
year.  It is thought that the city manager and at least one commissioner are 
protecting the suspect in order to protect themselves. 
      4) The city manager and one of the commissioners are having affairs 
with city employees which creates many problems with the work environment, 
not to mention the potential for sexual harrassment lawsuits if things go bad. 
      5) Past employees and citizens are struggling to seek assistance from 
various state departments with complaints relative to ethics, public record 
availability, and tampering with employee files. 
      6) Citizens are constantly complaining about harrassment from the city 
manager, but only get disrespect from the city commission when they try to 
address it. 
      The City of Lake Alfred experienced a computer crash in 1996, which 
even to today's newspaper, is the manager's excuse for all of the financial 
problems- even our utility bills have not been on time since since last 
October 2000 (running 1-2 months late). 

Whatever help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. Please feel 
free to call if you need more information or the names of former employees 
and citizens who are directly involved. Thank you.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Governor Bush - I believe that Chief Knight is the best candidate for the Florida Highway Patrol. His honesty and fair dealing are characteristics that have sadly been lacking under the current leadership. He has the full respect of his peers and is admired for his actions, rather than castigated for his inactions as has long been our curse to bear. The men and women of the Florida Highway Patrol need strong, fair leadership before a once great organization becomes but a mockery of itself. I urge you and the other Cabinet members to select Chief Knight as Director of the Florida Highway Patrol.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
    I hope you will recall the letter I sent you recently regarding our Florida adoption (current) and our thoughts on House Bill 141.  Thank you for your very kind response.
 
    I have never begged for help - certainly I have never had the "audacity" or perhaps just the gumption to request assistance from an elected official...but our baby and this adoption are so important to my husband and to myself, that I thought I would take the chance.
 
    You already know the story of the appearance of our "johnny come lately" birthfather - NOW that story is being complicated by the birth mother..
 
    We only "met" our birthmother on 1/2/01 - and our plans to adopt her baby were all made within 1-2 weeks of that first contact...Our baby was born on 1/31/01, which did not give us all much time to iron out very many "details."  HOWEVER, one thing that was discussed was the birthmother's expenses - not in specific terms, but in basic terms.  In NY a birthmother is allowed  3 months of expenses - 2 months before the baby's birth, one month after, or three months total before the baby's birth. These expenses must be approved by the court.  It seems that in Florida, things are a little different...although I do not know exactly "how" or "why."  
 
    Our birthmother told us initially that she did not want "anything" for expenses, because she did not want to feel as though she was "selling" her baby.  Our attorney told us to put some money into escrow for her and said that $3000 was a "reasonable and customary" amount.  We told our birthmother this, and she said that "she didn't want the money," and added that she would probably "tell the attorney to give the money back to you to use for the baby."  We told her that the money was hers, and it would be in escrow for her whenever she needed it.. and she agreed to that arrangement.
 
    Our attorney repeatedly asked her for an "expense account" of her monthly bills, but she never sent it to her...until last Friday.  THEN, our attorney received a laundry list of "expenses."  They included child care for her other two children (who only live with her part time), school supplies, money for a phone bill - when she did not have a phone until 2 weeks ago!!! - and other "miscellaneous" charges, including her credit card bill of $135.00 per month.  Her total monthly "expenses" added up to close to or over $2000 per month... which means that she is asking for approximately $12,000 in birthmother expenses.  Her excuse?  She was a waitress and believes she lost her job when she started to look too pregnant...
 
    She has also told our attorney (the agency attorney) that she is engaging the services of her own attorney - so that he can "help" her "get her money" and she expects us to pay his retainer ($2000) on her behalf.  She is saying that she we never really discussed an amount...and that she "heard" from either ME or one of her friends that she is "entitled" to six months of expenses by Florida law...I know that I never told her that, and her friend said she never did either. 
 
     Mr. Bush, to me this is extortion.  She has gone from wanting "nothing" to $12,000 in three month 's time...She knows we love our son, and do not want to lose him - to her OR to the birth father...she knows we will do anything to ensure that our baby remains with us...She knows that she agreed to $3000, that is why that amount was placed in escrow..Her request is NOT reasonable or customary - I am not arguing that our birthmother deserves to have expenses paid - but as I said, these, to my husband and myself, are not reasonable or customary - nor were they requested in a timely manner.  How could someone who claimed they did not want to feel as though they were "selling" their baby wait three months to ask for money, and then "throw out" a figure such as this?  Is this another "nuance" of Florida adoption laws that make adoption in Florida so
questionable??? 
   
    We came to Florida to adopt our baby with faith, love and trust in our hearts.  Our faith and our trust have been severely shaken - the only thing we really have left is our love for our little boy...a shining star in our lives.  
 
    I do not know how you can help us - I only know I needed for you to know the "rest" of our story...and I ned to know if there is anything that can be done?  is there anything in Florida adoption law, or other law, to protect us?  or is it really "adoptive parents beware" when it comes to a Florida adoption???
 
    Thank you for your time and understanding - 
 
   A very happy and blessed Easter to you and to your family - 
 
                                    Sincerely,
 
                                    Rosalie And Mark Baumann

Hi Julia,
The actual data will be released on June 6 at a press conference with
national
media at our Washington office.  The conference is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
We
can do something anytime after that initial release.  I am in Ft. Lauderdale
on
the 6th and 7th.  We don't necessarily need to do it on the same date -
might be
better if we wait and coordinate this with something else (and I don't know
what
that might be) that is of related interest and has the Governor's support or
interest.   The ideal would be to have all six mayors of the major high tech
cities - Orlando, Tampa, Melbourne, West Palm, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami for
a
press conference in Tallahassee.  Is there a Mayor's meeting any time soon
that
would have them up there?

As I said - I am open to anything and believe that this is a major deal for
Florida.  Upside Magazine will be doing a spread (we hope it is the cover
spread) for their September issue on the top five states.  Florida, of
course,
will be one of the five featured in the story.  Also, from last year, we
know
that there will be a press spotlight on the states that are in the top five.

I will have my copy of Cyberstates this week.  I can make arrangements to
have
it in the Governor's hands on June 6 at 8:30 a.m.  We are not able to
provide it
before - don't want it in reporters' hands by accident. We are releasing it
to
several media sources in Florida prior to the release with the strict
understanding that the data is embargoed until June 6.

Thanks for your offer to help - I gratefully accept and will follow whatever
suggestions/advice/direction you offer.

Dear Jeb:

I'm sorry I was unable to make it to the Majority Dinner on Saturday.  it
sounds like I missed a great event!  I understand you had a few minutes to
talk to Joan Galvin, our Communications Director, and that you
received your annual Mote shark pin!

I was disappointed to see that four of our projects made the Florida
TaxWatch list: (1) our sturgeon aquaculture program, which was chosen by
the Department for continued second year funding after being selected in
a competitive review by the Aquaculture Review Council.   The program,
as you know, has tremendous potential economic impact for the state and
has been a priority for DACS; (2) the non-recurring stock enhancement
funding is a one time appropriation supported by the agency (FWCC) and
will be put toward developing the redfish populations in Biscayne and Tampa
Bays; (3) With regard to FWCC's sawfish appropriation, we believe that
in light of the federal government's decision to propose the species for
placement on the endangered list, the research is timely and important
to ensure that the Florida Sawfish gets a fair shake; (4) Finally, I know
you are familiar with our request for SeaTrek distance learning funds this
year, and wanted to re-emphasize to you that this program provides
important educational programming for students all across the state.

TaxWatch's targeting of these programs, I believe, is not warranted as
these appropriations were awarded competitively where appropriate,
included in agency budgets and House or Senate budgets, and will benefit
all Floridians.  They do not satisfy TaxWatch's own criteria for listing
on the "Turkey" list.

Thanks again for your support of the Lab's progress.   Best wishes.

Dear Gov. Bush, 

I have recently been informed that some line items in the Department of 
Health Budget may be in jeopardy of a being vetoed. 

Line item 577A includes appropriations for Manatee County Rural Health 
Services, Inc. I would ask that you support these appropriations because they 
provide the citizens of Manatee County with much needed relief in the area of 
Health Care. 

These appropriations successfully made it through the legislative & 
departmental buget process and are included as a line item in the Department 
of Health Budget. Therefore, it is important to note that they do note meet 
the criteria for being considered "a turkey". 

MCRHS provides quality health care to nearly 37,000 people in our community. 
Over 1300 of these people are homeless. This organization serves people that 
would normally fall through the cracks. Over 57% of the patients served are 
uninsured and 73% of the patients are less than 200% above the Federal 
Poverty Level. 

MCRHS is a model Community based Health Center that other communities could 
learn from in how to serve the indigent and uninsured in an efficient and 
effective manner. Not only is MCRHS a great steward of tax dollars in the 
area of providing health care, but the quality of service rates among the 
best in the nation. MCRHS has received a 3 year accreditation from the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation for Health Care Organizations (JCAHO). The 3 year 
accreditation is the maximum recognition they provide. 

Governor Bush, I know you have many issues to consider while Leading our 
great state. I humbly ask that you support this line item in the budget. This 
appropriation will truly have a positive impact on the quality of life for 
many of Manatee County's Citizen's.  I would be happy to arrange a tour/visit 
if you are ever interested in seeing first hand a delivery model that has 
been recognized nationwide for serving the indigent and uninsured. 

Thank You for your time and consideration,

Governor,

	The 3 ships seized in the Miami River recently (Etoile De Mer,
Miguana, and Tacoma) are moving toward a sinking later this summer, most
likely for a reef off  Key Biscayn).   Titles have been transferred, dockage
fees waived or settled, and cleaning proceeding.  Marilyn Culp has
identified youth groups invovled in the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug
Free Community to "adopt" the ships.  Money from salvage parts will go
towards reimbursement of clean up operations, with remaining money split
between Customs and a special fund (most likely County or multi-Country) to
handle future operations such as these.

	We will be sure to create the proper public event (with youth
invovlement) around the actual sinkings.

	Elsewhere, we continue to make seizures related to Operation
Riverwalk.  The seizures are getting smaller (as the smugglers hedge their
bets) and they continue to divert from the Miami area (which we see as a
good outcome and one that we continue to capitalize on as we seize them
elsewhere).

	I am staying in close touch with the prosecutors as we move forward
in this operation.  Guy Lewis has some promising leads. 

	I will be going after more HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking
Area) money to sustain the operations.  The money comes from the Office of
National Drug Control Policy; once McCaffrey left in early January, those
managing the money there got tight or was diverted, so some of the expected
money dried up.  Kathleen is helping on this, so I'm optimistic we'll get
it.

	Bottom line, we're moving ahead on Riverwalk and the ship sinkings
with good prevention involement from youth in Miami.

Dear Governor:
    
As a concerned citizen, voter, property owner, and Republican in Walton 
County, I urgently ask that you veto any provision of bill 1053 which will 
apply to Walton County.   Several of the largest public interest groups in 
Walton County have spent years implementing community-supported signage 
criteria and ordinances which would in large measure be negated by this bill. 
 There is no doubt that the proliferation of non-locally regulated billboards 
in this county will be significantly detrimental to both individual and

Please assist us in protecting those interests by vetoing this legislation.

Specifically, we need help with the following: 
     1) 500 citizens (including more than the 20% required of registered 
voters) signed a petition which has been sent to the Joint Committee on 
Auditing requesting the Auditor General do a complete financial and 
operational audit of our city's finance department- we need this done as 
quickly as possible as there may be steps being taken to distroy records that 
may be needed during this audit. 
      2) Our city manager has a history of lying to the public which has 
destroyed public confidence in our local government. Appearances of collusion 
and conducting business outside of the sunshine are evident constantly among 
the manager and four of the five commissioners. 
      3)  Several thousands of dollars in utility payments are missing and 
an in-house police investigation has not come to a conclusion after nearly a 
year.  It is thought that the city manager and at least one commissioner are 
protecting the suspect in order to protect themselves. 
      4) The city manager and one of the commissioners are having affairs 
with city employees which creates many problems with the work environment, 
not to mention the potential for sexual harrassment lawsuits if things go bad. 
      5) Past employees and citizens are struggling to seek assistance from 
various state departments with complaints relative to ethics, public record 
availability, and tampering with employee files. 
      6) Citizens are constantly complaining about harrassment from the city 
manager, but only get disrespect from the city commission when they try to 
address it. 
      The City of Lake Alfred experienced a computer crash in 1996, which 
even to today's newspaper, is the manager's excuse for all of the financial 
problems- even our utility bills have not been on time since since last 
October 2000 (running 1-2 months late). 

Whatever help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. Please feel 
free to call if you need more information or the names of former employees 
and citizens who are directly involved. Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush, I and the members of Pick n' Poke Garden Club in Pensacola, 
FL. would like to ask your help. Would you please 
VETO CS HB1053/SB2056 - TRANSPORTATION BILL when it reaches your desk because 
of the billboard language retained in the bill. 
At the recent State Convention of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs 
(FFGC) the Billboards Forever Legislation, HB 1053 was opposed by RESOLUTION. 
FFGC and hundreds of members around the state and in our local counties sent 
messages to Florida's legislators requesting that this Bill not be passed. 
Please veto this bill.

Subject: golf plate


Dear Jeb,
As you are aware, the golf license plate passed this session and it is 
contained in the transportation bill. The plate is expected to generate 3 to 
5 million dollars to sustain junior golf programs across the state for many 
underprivileged and handicapped children who would never otherwise be 
exposed to, or realize their potential in the game of golf. It will provide 
many 'latch key' children a worthwile activity for several hours after 
school, teaching them numerous skills and keeping them occupied and out of 
trouble.

I am writing to urge you not to veto this bill.  I understand your concerns 
with the billboard issue and the Miami Airport but please consider all of 
the good legislation that will die and the possibility of readdressing these 
other important issues next session.

Regards,
Susan Goldstein

Dear Governor Bush,

I am the CEO/Executive Director of the Emergency Medical Foundation, Inc.
dba  EVAC Ambulance.  A not for profit corporation which is owned by the
Citizens of Volusia County, FL.   Senate Bill 510 is targeted at EVAC's 270
employees and their families.  This bill, unheard in committees, passed in
the waning days of session will eliminate private sector jobs and put them
in the public sector.  It will increase taxes and reduce services by
fragmenting a county wide agency in favor of municipal based fire
departments.  

Mr. Hayden Dempsey of your Executive Office took his valuable time to meet
with myself, the Volusia County Council Chairman and Ms Nora Hall to learn
the facts on this issue.   I greatly appreciated his time and interest.  I
realize your time is extremely limited, so I will not restate the facts.  

I urge you to VETO SB 510 as it is  very bad public policy.

Sincerely,

In DOT's budget, they have $17 million appropriated for the Toll Facility Revolving Trust Fund program.  The Santa Rosa request of $1.4 million would be satisfied from the $17 million.  While there may be some concerns on the use of such a fund, it has existed since 1986, and has awarded over $156.4 million for local and expressway and bridge authority projects.  Over $74.4 million has been repaid and "revolved" as new loans.  The program was created to develop and enhance the financial feasibility of revenue-producing road projects undertaken by local government entities.  In addition, most of the authorities generate enough revenue that the repayment of funds loaned through this program would not be a concern.  The $1.4 million item in proviso can be vetoed without eliminating all the funds in that appropriation.  While some interesting policy related issues were raised, and I believe they should be addressed -- internally and with DOT to see if the existing program is still sound policy.  If not, then we can take the appropriate action through the 2002-2003 budget process.

Jeb - 

Thanks for your response on our veto request, regarding Line Item 2032, 
Expressway Authorities, Revolving Toll Trust Fund. 

The $17 million is the  entire item, of which proviso language obligates 
$1.4 million to the "Bo's Bridge" bailout. 

Perhaps your lawyers can map out a strategy to veto only the $1.4 million if 
that is what you want to do, but I don't know if that can be accomplished - 
my hunch is that the entire $17 million may have to be vetoed to get to the 
Bo's Bridge item. 

BUT...We think you should seriously consider veto of the entire $17 million 
in any event.  The reality is that Bo's Bridge is just a symptom of the 
larger problem - an implied guarantee extended to expressway authorities 
that they can build speculative toll roads with assurance the state will 
come along and bail them out if they are so speculative that tolls fail to 
cover debit service. 

The process of encouraging these expressway authorities to build roads that 
are not going to pay for themselves in the near term is bad policy from both 
a fiscal and environmental perspective. It simply encourages "roads to 
nowhere" to please land speculators, and diverts money from highway projects 
that are truly needed by existing traffic NOW! 

Your veto of it could be accompanied by a call to a "summit" to be attended 
by DOT, expressway authorities, ect. The message would be - we are doing 
things differently from now on - no more state support for non-economic 
speculative roads that simply encourage urban sprawl in the wrong places. 

The whole "revolving toll trust fund" is now managed to harvest dollars from 
high traffic segments of the turnpike system and divert those funds to 
provide seed money for speculative expressways -- likely in the wrong, 
environmentally sensitive places. You can turn that around and direct that 
scarce road funds be much more carefully directed to urgently needed roads 
in existing urban areas. 

Chief current offenders (likely tomorrow's "Bo's Bridges") are: 

*  Suncoast Parkway Project extension in Citrus County 

*  St.Lucie County Expressway Authority (proposed bridges across Indian 
River Aquatic Preserve, and SEVERAL "Preservation 2000" land purchases) 

*  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority's proposed extension of 
Western Beltway up into Lake County (Sprawl promoting in rural lands) 

*  Santa Rosa Bay Bridge Authority new bridge from Pensacola to Pensacola 
Beach (would run right beside a non-toll bridge to same destination - sure 
to fail economically). 

Right now the local expressway authorities can propose these things with 
abandon - they have no risk. The state practice is to bail them out. 

Hope you will veto and say "NO MORE"! 


Charles

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Dear Governor and Cabinet, Thank you very much for hearing from me. I am a State Trooper proudly serving with the Florida Highway Patrol in Jefferson County. I would like to express to you my desire to see Chief Christopher Knight as the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol. Chief Knight is most knowledgable, very personable and has the skills to lead the FHP through the 21st century. And this is a time when we need effective, proactive leadership within this agency. Further, we need a strong, positive image that troopers, politicians and the public would respect. Chief Knight has all of this with plenty of experience to assist him with the difficult tasks he would face. I believe Chief Knight would be willing to change the old guard and make the FHP more progressive. And the reason I know this is the Chief was the first person from command staff to approach me and ask my humble opinion. He appeared open-minded and generally concerned for my well-being. Because of my duty assignment, I see and speak to Chief Knight often (as well as many of the others on the above list of nominees) and therefore I feel I can speak with sincerity on the issue. Have no doubt, Chief Knight will not fail you if chosen. Thank you again for the opportunity to address you.

This touched a nerve (or a gene, not sure which), so please forgive the lengthy and lofty e-mail.  
 
Each year, without question, we automatically send this organization over $200,000.  Then, when you start asking around, as I have done, no one can tell you what benefit the state actually derives for this gigantic sum of money.  What's really troubling is that I discovered this little gem randomly, after a lunch conversation with Cynthia, in which she and Barbara gave me anecdotal evidence of the fact that that state has many memberships to different organizations, that cost the state lots of money.  So, in digging a little deeper, I wanted to find out how much money is being spent on dues and membership in various organizations........drumroll please..........$1.1 million.  I've attached the spreadsheet that shows which agency is spending how much on what dues and memberships.  The largest line item was the Council of State Government.  
 
I find it ironic that in last year's spending reduction exercise, I am not aware of any agency who proposed meeting their goal through reducing these type of expenses.  The random discovery of this wasteful line-item suggests that there still may be fat out there, but unfortunately, it's probably marbled fat that requires a sophisticated method of extraction.  The most powerful tool we now have to extract what marbled fat may be out there is the new Savings Sharing program that was part of Service First.  Without the help of rank-and-file employees, we'll never be able to get at the marbled fat.  There still remains an untapped gold mine of ideas for savings money in the state employees.  
 
The trick is:  we've got to sincerely ask them and tell them that they will also reap the financial rewards for their good ideas.  If there were an internal communications campaign related to Savings Sharing, I expect that we will be overwhelmed with good cost-saving ideas, and our two biggest problems will be 1) how to handle the workload of properly assessing and implementing all of the good ideas, and 2) what to do with all of the left-over money we'll have from the savings.  I've recently heard two or three agency heads tell me that they're as lean as they can be, and I don't doubt that they believe that, and perhaps they are correct.  However, I'll bet that a single e-mail from Governor Bush or the agency head to all of any agency's employees regarding the Savings Sharing program and asking for good cost-saving ideas will disprove that assertion pretty quickly.

Governor, 
        An issue that we added to the list since we first went over them with you is the funding for the Council of State Governments.  The amount is $223,882 GR.  Florida has paid dues to this organization as long as I've been in budgeting and it was in the Governor's recommended budget because it's been in the base for so long.  No one had raised it as an issue before, so it has just carried forward.  It is a separate line item that can be vetoed if that's what you choose to do.  It's a D.

Re: Council of State Governments:
I've talked to staff on appropriations committees today and they tell me none of their members ever mention this organization to them.  However, I've talked with Ken Allman and found out there are a couple other components to this appropriation.  Of the $223,882 appropriation, about $209,000 of it is the amount that goes to the Council of State Governments and the rest goes for to the Southern Governor's Association and Ken believes some amount goes to the Southern Legislative Conference.  Another thing to consider is that we might get flack from some other states if we try to pull out.  Early in the Chiles administration they decided to stop paying dues to NGA.  Other states started putting a lot of pressure on Florida with Governor's calling, etc. so they resumed paying the dues.

Dear Jeb:

I'm sorry I was unable to make it to the Majority Dinner on Saturday.  it
sounds like I missed a great event!  I understand you had a few minutes to
talk to Joan Galvin, our Communications Director, and that you
received your annual Mote shark pin!

I was disappointed to see that four of our projects made the Florida
TaxWatch list: (1) our sturgeon aquaculture program, which was chosen by
the Department for continued second year funding after being selected in
a competitive review by the Aquaculture Review Council.   The program,
as you know, has tremendous potential economic impact for the state and
has been a priority for DACS; (2) the non-recurring stock enhancement
funding is a one time appropriation supported by the agency (FWCC) and
will be put toward developing the redfish populations in Biscayne and Tampa
Bays; (3) With regard to FWCC's sawfish appropriation, we believe that
in light of the federal government's decision to propose the species for
placement on the endangered list, the research is timely and important
to ensure that the Florida Sawfish gets a fair shake; (4) Finally, I know
you are familiar with our request for SeaTrek distance learning funds this
year, and wanted to re-emphasize to you that this program provides
important educational programming for students all across the state.

TaxWatch's targeting of these programs, I believe, is not warranted as
these appropriations were awarded competitively where appropriate,
included in agency budgets and House or Senate budgets, and will benefit
all Floridians.  They do not satisfy TaxWatch's own criteria for listing
on the "Turkey" list.

Thanks again for your support of the Lab's progress.   Best wishes.

I believe that Episode 47, of the Crocodile Hunter series with Steve Irwin, "Swimming with Alligators", is supposed to air Sunday June 16 at 8:00pm (CST?, check local listing) on Animal Planet.  This segment features three parts, one filmed in the Everglades, one at Silver Springs, and one at Eglin AFB.  The short segment filmed at Eglin in 1999 features Steve, his wife, Terri, myself, and two of my forestry rangers moving a nine foot aligator by hand.  It was an interesting experience watching Steve work, this was my second video with Steve, and his third feature on Eglin AFB.  I have an advance copy of the video, but they edit up to the last minute, and the final version is always a little different.  I hope you get a chance to see the feature!

Dear Ms. Shenkel:

I am responding to your email on behalf of the Governor.  I apologize for
not getting back to you earlier - I was out of town last week.

You are correct that private schools are not required to provide FAPE.  This
has been true for over 250,000 children in Florida's nonpublic schools for
many years. Some of Florida's most prominent citizens have for many years
enrolled their children in nonpublic institutions, even though these
institutions are not required to provide FAPE.

Under the McKay scholarship program parents who are dissatisfied can choose
another private or public school for their child.

The funds are intended to help these special needs children learn, whether
it is in a public or private setting. As you may be aware, Florida school
districts presently provide funds for thousands of ESE students to attend
nonpublic schools at public expense.
These are, for the most part, the students who are having the greatest
difficulty learning. If students leave these settings to attend a public
school in Florida the previous private provider keeps the funds they have
received. The school district receives no additional funds for these
students.

If a private school dismisses a student on a McKay scholarship no additional
payment is made after the student leaves. The nonpublic schools are paid on
a quarterly basis for the students they are educating.  If the student then
goes to a public school, then that school district can claim that student as
an FTE for purposing of funding.

Parents utilizing McKay scholarships are not able to sue the school district
if their child is not appropriately served in a private school.  The
students are attending the nonpublic school as the result of a private
parental placement. The federal Office of Civil Rights has recognized this
fact in a recent letter.

I hope this information has been helpful. If not please do not hesitate to
contact me and I will do my best to obtain additional information as quickly
as possible.

Sincerely,

Dear Gov. Bush, 

I have recently been informed that some line items in the Department of 
Health Budget may be in jeopardy of a being vetoed. 

Line item 577A includes appropriations for Manatee County Rural Health 
Services, Inc. I would ask that you support these appropriations because they 
provide the citizens of Manatee County with much needed relief in the area of 
Health Care. 

These appropriations successfully made it through the legislative & 
departmental buget process and are included as a line item in the Department 
of Health Budget. Therefore, it is important to note that they do note meet 
the criteria for being considered "a turkey". 

MCRHS provides quality health care to nearly 37,000 people in our community. 
Over 1300 of these people are homeless. This organization serves people that 
would normally fall through the cracks. Over 57% of the patients served are 
uninsured and 73% of the patients are less than 200% above the Federal 
Poverty Level. 

MCRHS is a model Community based Health Center that other communities could 
learn from in how to serve the indigent and uninsured in an efficient and 
effective manner. Not only is MCRHS a great steward of tax dollars in the 
area of providing health care, but the quality of service rates among the 
best in the nation. MCRHS has received a 3 year accreditation from the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation for Health Care Organizations (JCAHO). The 3 year 
accreditation is the maximum recognition they provide. 

Governor Bush, I know you have many issues to consider while Leading our 
great state. I humbly ask that you support this line item in the budget. This 
appropriation will truly have a positive impact on the quality of life for 
many of Manatee County's Citizen's.  I would be happy to arrange a tour/visit 
if you are ever interested in seeing first hand a delivery model that has 
been recognized nationwide for serving the indigent and uninsured. 

Thank You for your time and consideration, 

Frank Brunner 
Manatee County School Board Member

Governor Bush,
     It is my understanding that Bill 1053 on billboards across the state of 
Florida is before you for signature.
     I live in beautiful Santa Rosa Beach, Walton County, Florida in the 
panhandle.  We the residents are very active in local politics and in 
preserving the beauty and tranquility of our small community.  We are 
situated between Destin and Panama City.  
      Because Highway 98 carries traffic between these two popular tourist 
destinations, we are a target for every industrial sized billboard made.  We 
have chosen to control the scenic beauty of our area, including highways and 
thoroughfares, by electing people to local office who represent the will of 
the people who live here.  
      We do not want the state to act as big brother and override local 
control of our neighborhood and community.  There is enough of that from 
Washington, D.C.  We know what is best for us who live and work here. 
      I believe that elected officials often forget the true purpose of 
government and delve into many, many areas that are not their concern.  Local 
control is still best.  Please veto this bill.
Thank you,
Bonnie McQuiston

Re: Council of State Governments:
I've talked to staff on appropriations committees today and they tell me none of their members ever mention this organization to them.  However, I've talked with Ken Allman and found out there are a couple other components to this appropriation.  Of the $223,882 appropriation, about $209,000 of it is the amount that goes to the Council of State Governments and the rest goes for to the Southern Governor's Association and Ken believes some amount goes to the Southern Legislative Conference.  Another thing to consider is that we might get flack from some other states if we try to pull out.  Early in the Chiles administration they decided to stop paying dues to NGA.  Other states started putting a lot of pressure on Florida with Governor's calling, etc. so they resumed paying the dues.

I'm not aware that other states have dropped out.  Justin sent an email out a couple weeks ago asking about this organization and I was asked to put it on the list.  I'm not aware of what the thinking behing this is.  Prehaps Justin can tell us since he is the one who raised it.  I'm not aware that we (OPB at least) are receiving any benefit from the dues that we pay them.  In past years, the Legislature has been the body most interested in keeping the membership active.  At least we received requests from legislative staff to include the membership dues in the budget.

Governor, 
        An issue that we added to the list since we first went over them with you is the funding for the Council of State Governments.  The amount is $223,882 GR.  Florida has paid dues to this organization as long as I've been in budgeting and it was in the Governor's recommended budget because it's been in the base for so long.  No one had raised it as an issue before, so it has just carried forward.  It is a separate line item that can be vetoed if that's what you choose to do.  It's a D.

We are all very excited about it and we do need your help.  

I visited a visitation center in Daytona recently and it really hit home how
important these centers are to a community.  It never ceases to amaze me how
much both individuals and corporations have supported this project.  The
Junior Service League has brought the need for a family visitation center to
the attention of the community and we have gotten a great response.  I
realize that you have many requests for funding and that you can only
support so many, but I feel that this is very important.  This project has
too much potential to be overlooked.

I personally look forward to the day when we open our doors and accept the

Governor:
YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Are you certain however, that the compromise DOES NOT ALLOW for a 3rd lane to be turned into a permanent 4th lane after a period of time? Is it certain that it will remain ONLY a 3 lane roadway PERMANENTLY?
Our concern is that this compromise amenable to all groups concerned is not a TRUE compromise but one that will only Forestall the inevitable 4 lane highway.
 
I really am exhilarated as are many of your constituents that you support this compromise IF indeed it is going to TRULY remain 3 lanes on that 18 mile stretch.
 
One last note, at a dinner party at Mr. Woody Weiser's home in late May in Miami, I met Mr. Alberto Codina (for the first time) who was also vehemently opposed to 4laning the stretch. I believe he had had an encounter with Mr. Walter Revell on the subject awhile back. 
 
We spoke at length about this expansion since he had not been fully briefed by Mr. Revell. I was pleasantly surprised to his reaction since not only is he a leading S. Fla builder he seems to me on first impression an intelligent, caring, successful familyman whose opinion I respected instantly; beside the fact that I am aware that you have been business-partners in the past.
 
Well its been very interesting corresponding with you Sir, I hope those questions do not remain unaswered.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a current resident of your State and would like to congratulate you in your efforts to develop our State's social and economic structures and your administration's progressive policies.
 
The reason for this note however, is to suggest that in your next runoff you should be aware of two critical issues if indeed janet reno runs for office:
 
1. Based on her last interview with Judy Woodruff (last week) on Inside Politics she stated that if she decides to run she will do so on an environmental platform. This of course will pave the way for the environmentalists and powerful citizens of the Keys to give her their votes if in fact you decide to expand that 18-mile stretch into a full blown highway. 
 
Given my involvement in this project I would like to request that you give your final decision on whether to 4-lane or maintain a safer 2/3 lane roadway careful consideration as the outcome of this project could indeed be one of various sins when falling from grace. 
 
I will support and vote for you to ensure that you win in the next elections however, I find it critical that you pay closer attention to certain environmental issues at stake in our State as well as the educational issues looming darkly over this peninsula. 
 
Janet Reno will ensure that these two hot topics become her strongest political allies and thus use your own policies on these against you.
 
I as well as many Floridians I know would hate to see you loose against this woman on issues that you seem to care a great deal about and would probably be very successful implementing stronger and more progressive legislation if given the opportunity.
 
Please reconsider your position on 4laning the 18 mile stretch as it is a crucial decision affecting not only the quality of life of our local citizens but our only continental reef in this country and our National Marine Sanctuary.
 
Thank you for your time and interest and never, never, never give up!!! (WC)

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I have been a Trooper for 10+ years. I have known all the candidates for several of those years. One candidate stands out from the rest. I have had dealings with all the above candidates at some time or another. I believe Chief Knight will be progressive enought to take the patrol in the proper direction, and provide the insight to make wise decisions. I am a firm believer that whoever is given this opportunity should be someone from within this fine organization. Thank you for listening.

A Chilean Space Agency?

Today's issue of the Santiago Times (English language translation of Chile's leading newspaper) contained an interesting story concerning the possibility that Chile could establish a civilian space agency. In November 2000, the Chilean Air Force announced plans to create its own space agency and to send a Chilean astronaut into space by 2005. The Air Force has also asked NASA to allow a Chilean astronaut to join a future space shuttle mission.

The article in the Santiago Times quoted the director of the Center of Space Studies at the University of Chile, Eduardo Diaz, who suggested an alternative. Diaz said: "if Chile is serious about developing a space program, the country needs to create a space agency that is not under the control of the military, as the government and private investors are reluctant to commit funds to what some have described as a prestige project for [the Air Force]."

The story went on to quote Diaz as saying: "we should focus on applying space technology to our own country rather than thinking about outer space, Diaz said. A Chilean Space Agency should be 100 percent civilian. It should implement a program based on the countrys real problems rather than on the wishes of those in uniform."

Dear Jeb,
As you are aware, the golf license plate passed this session and it is 
contained in the transportation bill. The plate is expected to generate 3 to 
5 million dollars to sustain junior golf programs across the state for many 
underprivileged and handicapped children who would never otherwise be 
exposed to, or realize their potential in the game of golf. It will provide 
many 'latch key' children a worthwile activity for several hours after 
school, teaching them numerous skills and keeping them occupied and out of 
trouble.

I am writing to urge you not to veto this bill.  I understand your concerns 
with the billboard issue and the Miami Airport but please consider all of 
the good legislation that will die and the possibility of readdressing these 
other important issues next session.

Regards,
Susan Goldstein

Dear Governor Bush,

I am the CEO/Executive Director of the Emergency Medical Foundation, Inc.
dba  EVAC Ambulance.  A not for profit corporation which is owned by the
Citizens of Volusia County, FL.   Senate Bill 510 is targeted at EVAC's 270
employees and their families.  This bill, unheard in committees, passed in
the waning days of session will eliminate private sector jobs and put them
in the public sector.  It will increase taxes and reduce services by
fragmenting a county wide agency in favor of municipal based fire
departments.  

Mr. Hayden Dempsey of your Executive Office took his valuable time to meet
with myself, the Volusia County Council Chairman and Ms Nora Hall to learn
the facts on this issue.   I greatly appreciated his time and interest.  I
realize your time is extremely limited, so I will not restate the facts.  

I urge you to VETO SB 510 as it is  very bad public policy.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Miami River - Seized Ship Sinkings

Governor,

	The 3 ships seized in the Miami River recently (Etoile De Mer,
Miguana, and Tacoma) are moving toward a sinking later this summer, most
likely for a reef off  Key Biscayn).   Titles have been transferred, dockage
fees waived or settled, and cleaning proceeding.  Marilyn Culp has
identified youth groups invovled in the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug
Free Community to "adopt" the ships.  Money from salvage parts will go
towards reimbursement of clean up operations, with remaining money split
between Customs and a special fund (most likely County or multi-Country) to
handle future operations such as these.

	We will be sure to create the proper public event (with youth
invovlement) around the actual sinkings.

	Elsewhere, we continue to make seizures related to Operation
Riverwalk.  The seizures are getting smaller (as the smugglers hedge their
bets) and they continue to divert from the Miami area (which we see as a
good outcome and one that we continue to capitalize on as we seize them
elsewhere).

	I am staying in close touch with the prosecutors as we move forward
in this operation.  Guy Lewis has some promising leads. 

	I will be going after more HIDTA (High Intensity Drug Trafficking
Area) money to sustain the operations.  The money comes from the Office of
National Drug Control Policy; once McCaffrey left in early January, those
managing the money there got tight or was diverted, so some of the expected
money dried up.  Kathleen is helping on this, so I'm optimistic we'll get
it.

	Bottom line, we're moving ahead on Riverwalk and the ship sinkings
with good prevention involement from youth in Miami.

Karen, thanks for writing. Putting aside speculation, what evidence do you
see that suggests I would like to dismantle public education?

It can't be the record increase funding in the last three years? It can't be
the high standards and accountability that you and I support? It can't be
the rising test scores? It can't be the advocacy for the ESE students? Or
the teacher retention and recruitment law we most recently passed? Or the
mentoring initiative? Or the family literacy initiative? Or the Power Up
initiative?

I share your view that we can do better and must do better to give kids a
chance for a brighter tomorrow. I know that a vast majority of students will
be in public schools and we need to support them.

Again, thanks for writing. I look forward to working with you on our common

Dear Governor Bush,

Though I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting you personally I continue
to hear high praise for your accomplishments as Governor.

At the end of last week I met with Ken Wright regarding a development/school
capacity issue in Orange County.  During the meeting he made a statement
that struck a cord:  that we are working within a broken system.  I shared
with Mr. Wright some of the challenges that I am currently struggling with
within OCPS.  After further discussion he suggested that I speak to you and
Speaker Feeney.

It is very important that I have a clear understanding of your vision and
goals for public education and I must admit that I am a little confused.
There is speculation that you and Speaker Feeney wish to "dismantle" public
education rather than "fix" it.  I would appreciate a short reply stating
your position regarding the future of K-12 public education.

In a nutshell, I support opportunity scholarships because they are tied to
student achievement and the standards are more than reasonable;  I do (did)
not support growth vouchers because they are not tied to student achievement
and would not, in my opinion, effectively meet the challenges of growth.  I
welcome accountability. I am committed to effecting systemic change to
create a responsive public school system that meets the needs of our
community.

I look forward to working with you and our legislators toward our common
goals,

I am in receipt of the recommendations for the Florida State Board of

Ms. Jackson is the wife of the Deputy Secretary of HUD and hopefully this
will not preclude her from serving.  I personally think she would be a great
member of the board.  It is my considered opinion that she would be a
tremendous asset to the team.  I would appreciate your serious consideration
of making this substitution.
Thanking you in advance,

Gov. Jeb Bush's selection of two south floridians to serve on the new state Board of Education is one more way for the governor to get proponents of charter schools involved in state school  issues.  The appointees are T. Willard Fair, chief executive of the Urban League of Miami and founder of the Liberty City Charter School, and Linda Eads the founding principle of the Mast Academy magnet marine-lab high school on Virginia Key.
 
For six months the FAA has been testing different approaches to Miami International Airport aircraft in order to decrease noise over residential neighborhoods from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. The tests, which end on Jun. 11, 2001 show that keeping planes over water prior to their descent reduces aircraft noise.  Residents along the coast of Miami have long complained about the noise of incoming and outgoing aircraft.  This test program covered only aircraft arriving at night from the east.

I am writing in the  hopes you will veto HB 1053.  I am very disappointed our legislators passed it and believe it goes against the principles of our Republican Party: 

1.	The Republican Party believes in equal rights, equal justice and equal opportunity for all: 


	
a. HB 1053 creates a new extra privilege for billboards not available to other types of personal property.  


	b. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of the "carve-outs" that were created for communities with powerful legislators. 
The Republican Party believes the most effective, responsible and responsive government is government closest to the people.  HB 1053 overturns local decisions and substitutes "big government" mandates  Please veto this bill.
Sincerely,
Annette Sheringo

Governor Bush, I am B.J,McCorkle of Jacksonville, Fl. I am on the board of 
directors for Jax Pride. I am also the vice-chair of the Southwest CPAC, and   
on the Planning Commission here. I firmly believe that we have a very good 
law about the billboard signs here. We all worked hard to remove this blight 
in our city, and we are working equally as hard to make Jacksonville a 
beautiful example of how a city shoud look. I beg YOU , as our governor to 
veto this bill and let us continue our quest to beautify our city. 

                                                                     Thank

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I feel Chief Chris Knight best represents the interest of the Troopers and the citizens of the state of FLorida. We were at one time the elite law enforcement agency in the state. It seems the sheriff's have taken that role. That seems to mainly be due to a lack of manpower. Chief Knight is still young and has many years ahead of him in this organization. It is time for a new generation to take command and lead us into the 21st century. A different type of thinking is needed to bring newer ideas to the state for problems of manpower and equipment, etc.

Chief John Czernis is my recommendation for the position of Colonel of the Florida Highway Patrol. I worked for Chief Czernis for many years in the Orlando area. I always found him to be fair and sensitive to the needs of minority troopers. His door was always open to hear any comments, suggestions or problems that I had. I believe he will be a productive and fair Colonel to lead the Florida Highway Patrol. Thank you and good luck with the very tough decision ahead.

Dear Governor Bush,

Once again the Billboard Lobby in Florida is making a run at tying the
hands of local governments to control the clutter of roadside billboards. 
This time it is through HB1053 that has passed the legislature and is now
heading you way.  As I understand it, the bill takes away the ability of
some local governments to deal with billboards but allows other local
governments more latitude because of their political clout. Sound like Big
Government to me.  Isn't that what the Republican Party is against?  Please
let local governments make their own decisions.  Imagine if the people in
Portland were making the decisions for the people in Kennebunkport. You and
your family can see what damage that would cause.

On the subject reimbursement, the bill creates a special property rights
for billboards that are not available to other personal property.  By
signing this bill you will open the flood gates for every business to
demand that they not only be compensated for the actual property value but
be compensated for the income that property may have generated for the next
five or ten years.  No municipality, even the State would be able to pay
that cost.  We would never be able to purchase property and businesses in
the state to build or widen roads ever again.  Jeb, please veto this BAD
bill.

By the way, congrats on running for a second term.  Don't let HR1053 mess
up the reelection
Campaign.

Governor, 
        An issue that we added to the list since we first went over them with you is the funding for the Council of State Governments.  The amount is $223,882 GR.  Florida has paid dues to this organization as long as I've been in budgeting and it was in the Governor's recommended budget because it's been in the base for so long.  No one had raised it as an issue before, so it has just carried forward.  It is a separate line item that can be vetoed if that's what you choose to do.  It's a D.

Specifically, we need help with the following: 
     1) 500 citizens (including more than the 20% required of registered 
voters) signed a petition which has been sent to the Joint Committee on 
Auditing requesting the Auditor General do a complete financial and 
operational audit of our city's finance department- we need this done as 
quickly as possible as there may be steps being taken to distroy records that 
may be needed during this audit. 
      2) Our city manager has a history of lying to the public which has 
destroyed public confidence in our local government. Appearances of collusion 
and conducting business outside of the sunshine are evident constantly among 
the manager and four of the five commissioners. 
      3)  Several thousands of dollars in utility payments are missing and 
an in-house police investigation has not come to a conclusion after nearly a 
year.  It is thought that the city manager and at least one commissioner are 
protecting the suspect in order to protect themselves. 
      4) The city manager and one of the commissioners are having affairs 
with city employees which creates many problems with the work environment, 
not to mention the potential for sexual harrassment lawsuits if things go bad. 
      5) Past employees and citizens are struggling to seek assistance from 
various state departments with complaints relative to ethics, public record 
availability, and tampering with employee files. 
      6) Citizens are constantly complaining about harrassment from the city 
manager, but only get disrespect from the city commission when they try to 
address it. 
      The City of Lake Alfred experienced a computer crash in 1996, which 
even to today's newspaper, is the manager's excuse for all of the financial 
problems- even our utility bills have not been on time since since last 
October 2000 (running 1-2 months late). 

Whatever help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. Please feel 
free to call if you need more information or the names of former employees 
and citizens who are directly involved. Thank you.

The appropriation identified below received the honor of being

FAU/HBOI Marine Science Partnership (P)
$997,860
St. Lucie

Florida Atlantic University has a marine science program in education 
and research that is growing rapidly and gaining in stature and 
recognition.  It is extremely popular with students, both 
undergraduates and graduate students, and is destined to be the 
pre-eminent marine science program on Florida's east coast.  The 
development of this program includes a partnership with Harbor Branch 
Oceanographic Institution, one of the most highly regarded 
oceanographic institutions in the country,  which is providing unique 
educational opportunities for Florida's next generation.  This bill 
will enable support of the partnership and the continued delivery of 
high quality science education to the Florida populace as FAU grows 
and provides service to its northern campuses in St. Lucie county. 
It will allow the placement of resident faculty and students for this 
partnership.

Current issues such as the drought, commercial development of the 
coastal zone, and pollution of marine resources are affecting the 
future of Florida's east coast.  This partnership will be able step 
up to the plate and provide the expertise needed now and the 
subsequent educated generations to deal with these and future issues. 
To do this we will need your support.

I ask you to support the FAU/HBOI Marine Science Partnership with 
your vote of confidence.

Subject:	Appropriation for FAU/HBOI Marine Science Partnership

Dear Governor Bush,

The appropriation identified below received the honor of being 
selected for the 2001 Turkey Watch List by the Florida Tax Watch 
Research Institute.  However, in this case the designation "turkey" 
should mean the role that this magnificent bird has as the 
centerpiece at Thanksgiving, one of our cherished institutions.

Conference Bill 2001-02
Appropriation 18
FCO - State University System Projects
FAU/HBOI Marine Science Partnership (P)
$997,860
St. Lucie

Florida Atlantic University has a marine science program in education 
and research that is growing rapidly and gaining in stature and 
recognition.  It is extremely popular with students, both 
undergraduates and graduate students, and is destined to be the 
pre-eminent marine science program on Florida's east coast.  The 
development of this program includes a partnership with Harbor Branch 
Oceanographic Institution, one of the most highly regarded 
oceanographic institutions in the country,  which is providing unique 
educational opportunities for Florida's next generation.  This bill 
will enable support of the partnership and the continued delivery of 
high quality science education to the Florida populace as FAU grows 
and provides service to its northern campuses in St. Lucie county. 
It will allow the placement of resident faculty and students for this 
partnership.

Current issues such as the drought, commercial development of the 
coastal zone, and pollution of marine resources are affecting the 
future of Florida's east coast.  This partnership will be able step 
up to the plate and provide the expertise needed now and the 
subsequent educated generations to deal with these and future issues. 
To do this we will need your support.

I ask you to support the FAU/HBOI Marine Science Partnership with 
your vote of confidence.

Sincerely,
Guri Roesijadi, Chair
Department of Biological Sciences
Florida Atlantic University
Boca Raton, FL

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Dear Governor Bush and honorable Cabinet Members, thank you for this opportunity to express my feelings in regard to the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol. I have been with the patrol since May 1974 and have seen a lot of leaders come and go. Never in those 28 years have I seen a stronger leader than Chris Knight. He has the ability to lead the patrol into the 21 century along with bringing the moral back up to where it needs to be. The patrol has many issues that need to be addressed that are long overdue. Please do not pass up this golden opportunity to put us back on track. There are hundreds upon hundreds of us that feel this way. Please help us.

Sorry, I just realized that I didn't answer your question re: what they do.  They provide a network for state governments and provide research, policy papers, educational programs, referral services, etc.  They are nonprofit and suppose to be nonpartisan.  As far as I know, all states do pay dues and I believe the amount of dues are based on population with the larger states paying more.  I will give you their website in case you are interested in looking at it.

Governor, 
        An issue that we added to the list since we first went over them with you is the funding for the Council of State Governments.  The amount is $223,882 GR.  Florida has paid dues to this organization as long as I've been in budgeting and it was in the Governor's recommended budget because it's been in the base for so long.  No one had raised it as an issue before, so it has just carried forward.  It is a separate line item that can be vetoed if that's what you choose to do.  It's a D.

Hi:
 
I just reminded Greg Munson that I haven't heard anything about him helping with Fred Washington.  He's the student of mine who is accused of murder who I know did not and couldn not have done it.  I filed papers with the district court of appeals and county court.  He called me tonight and told me he received acknowledgements.  I asked Greg if I should send him a copy, but he hasn't answered me.
 
Jeb - this may sound strange to you - but I have off the weeks of July 16 and July 23.  Is there anyway that you could arrange that I would be able to spend some time with Fred - at least an overnight visit.  I wouldn't mind if they handcuffed me to him and took anything they wanted as collateral to bring him back.  I just want to get him out of there and talk to him and give him some encouragement.  He's up in Gulf Correctional which is at least 6-8 hours from Broward.  If I were to drive up, I would like to stay overnight somewhere near there.  Like I once told you, I'm the only one who communicates with him.  His entire family doesn't.  He was the perfect student and in my heart I know he's there in error.
 
Thanks!  Hope all is well with you.  I understand that you did sign the sick pay bill for school administrators.  I know you thought about it a lot and want you to know I still love ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jeb:

I know that you are overwhelmed with appropriation decisions and bills
from this past session.


This issue of the School of Chiropractic Medicine at the FSU Panama City
Campus is very important to me.  It has been through the entire process
and more, the Legislative process, the Board of Regents, the
Postseconadary Education Commission and MGT of America.

As far as I know it was not on the Taxwatch Turkey list for what ever
that's worth.

I have even seen letters of support from at least three of the private
chiropractic colleges, Southern California University of Health
Sciences, New York Chiropractic College and the National University of
Health Sciences.  I don't know if your staff shares these letters with
you, but all were in support for all the reasons that have been stated
to you before.

Minority access to the profession, economic development to the Panama
City area, an opportunity to lower the over-all costs of spiraling
health care costs as we have shown we can do with the Florida
Chiropractic Medicaid Program. The list goes on and on.

Governor,  the PECO dollars that will be needed at the FSU Panama City
site will be used for exactly what they are meant for, offering
educational opportunities for Florida residents.

Is there anything further that you need to allow this appropriations
item to become law? Allow history to be made in Florida by becoming the
first state to offer a chiropractic education in the public sector?

I do hope I will not be disappointed on June 16th.

As Ever,

Dennis L. Jones

Based on their frequently asked questions page, they serve executive, legislative and judicial branches.  But in Florida, I think the Florida Legislature has always had more contact with them than the Governor's Office, so they may give the Legislature preferential treatment.  I don't mind you asking the questions!  I wish I knew more to tell you about them.

Dear Governor:
    
As concerned citizens in Walton County, I urgently ask that you veto any provision of bill 1053 which will apply to Walton County.   Several of the largest 
public interest groups in Walton County have spent years implementing community-supported signage criteria and ordinances which would in large measure be negated by this bill.  There is no doubt that the proliferation of 
non-locally regulated billboards in this county will be significantly detrimental to both individual and business interests in our community.  
 
We are trying very hard to keep our scenic highways scenic.
 
Please assist us in protecting those interests by vetoing this legislation.

Thank you for your attention and assistance.

Florida has paid dues to this organization as long as I've been in budgeting and it was in the Governor's recommended budget because it's been in the base for so long.  No one had raised it as an issue before, so it has just carried forward.  It is a separate line item that can be vetoed if that's what you choose to do.  It's a D.

I'm not aware that other states have dropped out.  Justin sent an email out a couple weeks ago asking about this organization and I was asked to put it on the list.  I'm not aware of what the thinking behing this is.  Prehaps Justin can tell us since he is the one who raised it.  I'm not aware that we (OPB at least) are receiving any benefit from the dues that we pay them.  In past years, the Legislature has been the body most interested in keeping the membership active.  At least we received requests from legislative staff to include the membership dues in the budget.

It passed the house and senate in different forms but we did not pursue it. The plan was to pump untreated water into an non drinking aquifer 1000 feet down and treat it when it came back up. It is a proven and used technology called aquifer storage recovery. We can seek a waiver from the epa to do what the bill called for.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I'm writing to show my support of your VETO of HB 1053, the Billboards Forever Legislation.  As a man who supports home rule and the preservation of our state's natural resources, I ask that you veto this legislation.  
 
If anything worthwhile were to come out of this proposal, it would be your determination to put a moratorium on billboard displays.  Florida is a beautiful state, and it once was even more scenic prior to the poorly managed growth.  Corporate greed has displaced the citizens desires in this arena and it is time to listen to your constituents.  
 
Please veto HB 1053.

Dear Governor Bush:

This year legislators reduced the combined funding of Everglades
Restoration and Land Acquisition by $75 million claiming a "tight budget",
yet they still found ways to put hundreds of millions of dollars worth of "Member Projects" in the state budget.  You publicly criticized this shifting of Preservation 2000 funding.
 
I urge you to veto these special "Member Projects" that waste money and potentially harm the environment.

These special projects include
 
        $1.6 million in improvements to the Rodman reservoir which are only needed if
the reservoir is retained and the Ocklawaha River not restored;

        $250,000 to study building a dam on the Yellow River in Okaloosa County;
 
        $17 million in toll trust fund money allocated to bail out the economically failing "Bo's Bridge" in Santa Rosa County and toward questionable expressway projects in environmentally sensitive areas; and
 
        $300,000 for an unnecessary Sovereign Lands study.
 
You have previously been opposed to special, local member projects and I hope you will stand strong this year and veto the above spending excesses.
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush,
I'm writing in support of the "All Products" legislation. I understand the insurance industry is opposed and that the pending bill allows a physician the right to refuse any present or future plans proffered by the industry. This is only common sense, and protects the physician against any future predatory actions on the part of insurance companies. Please sign this important legislation.

Dear Jeb: 

 I know the state does not like to interfere in city Government, they like 
to wait till it hits the fan so they can say they had no hand in the city's 
problems. 
 When are they going to wake up? We have a problem here and instead of it 
going away it gets worse.  If you could talk to former employees, and there 
are to many qualified people that were let go by our city Mgr. for 
questionable reasons because they were threatened with bad recommendations if 
they spoke out about how the city is run.  All we hear at City Commission 
Meetings when problems arise are excuses, put offs or just told to " Shut Up" 
" We don't need anyone looking over our shoulders" or " Most of the 
troublemakers are new residents why cant we go back to the old days" 
 There is plenty of smoke here can you help put out this fire????? 
Thank You for your precious time.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

To Whom It May Concern; I would like to recommend Chief Cristopher Knight for the position as Director of The Florida Highway Patrol. I have been a member of the department for 13 years and have seen Chief Knight's work and interest in making our department the very best. Chief Knight has demonstrated in many ways his ability to lead the Florida Highway Patrol and I strongly believe that he will receive the greatest support in building our division.Chief Knight is an honest individual, very ambitious to his work, dedicated to reaching goals and productivity in a possitve way, and most important he is very supportive to the men and women in our department. In my oppinion this is the quality of person that our depatment has long awaited since the departing of our previous Director Col. Ron Grimming. In summary I strongly feel that Chief Knight will be a great asset to you all and to The Florida Highway Patrol as a Dependable Leader who will assist not only us, but all of you as well in the leadership and guidance of our department. I would like to thank each of you in advance for you carefull consideartion in this very impoprtant matter. Sinceraly, Trooper Roberto Alonso

Dear Senator Burt and Rep. Crow:

Enclosed I am forwarding you the Court Watch Program Bill, please see if you 
can sponsor it or assist in any way.

Please also inform as to your status on this issue.

There are a couple of things that also need to be considered in the Bill:

1)  That it can also have a right to incorporate other court watch programs 
throughout the state, with a proper contract and abiding with set rules and 
procedures and laws that it would apply;
2)  I forgot to incorporate a Programmer / Computer Analyst in the budget (it 
is mentioned to sorts in the Bill) -- maybe the Executive Ass't salary could 
go towards the Computer person.

Thank you in advance for your prompt cooperation and prompt assistance to 
this matter.

Gov. Bush, has it for next year with his Legislative.

Regards,

Sofia

Governor - 
I urge you to sign the legislative appropriation bills which fund Treasure 
Coast programs such as the Hibiscus Children's Center Prenatal program, and 
funding for the St. Lucie River Initiative. These are proven programs 
desperately in need of state funding to survive. Thank you for your 
consideration of this issue.

The governor said he intends to ignore that effort and "stay focused on what really matters . . . This is about Florida. This is about our future." He then hit directly at two of the most controversial issues of his administration -- One Florida and civil service reform. 


  _____  

I might be wrong about this but I don't think that civil service reform is controversial outside of the Tallahassee area.

Again I am emailing you to ask you to support the Ringling Museum in full.  Florida Taxwatch has desginated some of the appropriations to the Museum as "turkeys".
Please remember that the Ringling Museum is THE state museum.

Dear Governor Bush:

This year legislators reduced the combined funding of Everglades
Restoration and Land Acquisition by $75 million claiming a "tight budget",
yet they still found ways to put hundreds of millions of dollars worth of "Member Projects" in the state budget.  You publicly criticized this shifting of Preservation 2000 funding.
 
I urge you to veto these special "Member Projects" that waste money and potentially harm the environment.

These special projects include
 
        $1.6 million in improvements to the Rodman reservoir which are only needed if
the reservoir is retained and the Ocklawaha River not restored;

        $250,000 to study building a dam on the Yellow River in Okaloosa County;
 
        $17 million in toll trust fund money allocated to bail out the economically failing "Bo's Bridge" in Santa Rosa County and toward questionable expressway projects in environmentally sensitive areas; and
 
        $300,000 for an unnecessary Sovereign Lands study.
 
You have previously been opposed to special, local member projects and I hope you will stand strong this year and veto the above spending excesses.
 
Thank you,
Pam Zaber

Subject:	HB 1053

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to urge you to veto HB 1053 which creates special property rights for billboards which do not pertain to other personal property.  This bill is bad public policy for several reasons.

       --It provides special privileges for some politically powerful areas.
       --It is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the
Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic beauty.
       --It serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too many inappropriately placed billboards.
        -- It is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.   The ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected councils and commissions, and is inconsistent with your own previous support for decisions being made by local government.
 
Please veto this terrible law.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Dear Governor Bush, Greetings. You and the Cabinet have a very important decision ahead of you. The selection of Director or the "Colonel" for the Florida Highway Patrol is a crucial decision and I do not envy you the task, I would like to encourage you all and let you know that my wife and I are praying for you in your decision making process. By now, I am sure as a result of reviewing their portfolios you are undoubtably familiar with the candidates. You are probably familiar with the Patrol as a Division of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. I just would like to take a moment of your time and let you get to know the mentality of a Trooper. As Troopers we are taught to be self sufficient, and self motivated. We all have our beginnings in one place, the Academy. We are a proud breed. In that regard, we are a lot like the Marine Corps, (we even make them go through our academy to become troopers) we have a common bond and we are never ashamed to be called "Trooper" by the public at large no matter what our rank. While there are thoase that have left the Patrol for other agencies (our pitiful allowance some call a salary is usually the main culprit for jumping ship) there is still that bond between us. Call it shared experiences. That said, to have an "outsider" come in would be a mistake. It has been tried, and quite frankly set the Patrol back in some areas. To look outside the agency for candidates would be acceptable were there no qualified applicants for the job from within the ranks. Sheriff Lancaster causes many of us in the rank and file great distress. He has been a vocal critic of the Patrol in the past. In addition, he is not familiar with the agency structure, dealing with the legislative process or more importantly the mentality of the rank and file Trooper. I fear, the walls would come tumbling down should he be selected. In my short 14 year career, I have had dealings with all of the candidates from within. I have always had positive interactions with them. The only one whom I have never heard a bad word said about and that I would absolutely trust with the job is Chief Chris Knight. He has always been a "square shooter", and an effective manager. He is personable, a good communicator and an all around good man.

Subject: VETO OF HB 1157


Dear Governor:

Jim Bailey, with Bailey Publications, noted to me that you had a concern
about newspapers' pending  request of a veto of HB 1157, in that you
believed that government should not be used as a means to protect
franchises whose value would be limited in an open marketplace.

I agree with you...but I also believe that the state should not spend
tax dollars to provide services that are already being provided by the
free enterprise marketplace.

I wanted to mention a couple of things regarding that issue, of which
you may not be aware.

First, the Florida Press Association, which represents Florida's daily
and weekly newspapers,  already has a statewide Internet site on line to
which Florida newspapers are uploading their legal ads
---floridapublicnotices.com---which is available at no charge to the
public.  At this time the newspapers already participating reflect a
combined circulation of 1.4 million. We are adding newspapers to the
site daily, and plan to have most all of the legal ads in the state on
line by the end of the year....at no cost to the public!

Had we had an opportunity to testify on HB 1157 or if the Deparmtent of
State had indicated their interest in this before quietly adding it as
an amendment on another bill, perhaps we could have explained our
program and worked together to ensure the best service for all of
Florida. Unfortuantely we were not made aware of the bill until it was
already passed.

In testimony, however, I would have to tell you that I would have urged
the committee not to adopt this amendment as it is going to cost the
Department of State public dollars to perform a task which is already
being addressed by private enterprise.

The newspaper industry is currently publishing  most all legal notices
in the state now. These can be uploaded to the floridapublicnotices.com
Internet site with the punch of a button, and at  little cost. This
enables those persons who desire to get this information from the
Internet the opportunity to do so, while not depriving the majority who
get such information from newspapers from doing so.

In addition, the newspapers are planning to run standing ads in every
edition in the state continually informing the public of the location
and content of the legal ad website. There is no more effective means
that I know of to make this information more easily available to ALL of
the public. And it is provided by private industry at no cost to the
public.

Secondly, one of the purposes of  publication of legal notices in
newspapers is for historic preservation. The legal ads become a part of
the history of that community and can be retrieved  at later dates to
prove satisfaction of legal requirements, help resolve disputes, for
historical purposes, or for confirmation of inquiries by citizens or
researchers. Newspaper accounts are often used as major sources of
history by writers, researchers and social scientists.

Finally, let me note a personal belief that newspapers, especially in
smaller communities, are the lifeblood for communal information. They
are the entry point in the community's "personal information stream"
from which most citizens get a large portion of  their working knowledge
and information about current events, coming events, local causes,
historical perspective, local commerce, etc. which directly impacts and
lubricates the daily personal and business interaction of those citizens
in that community. The more information about local events that is
easily available to those disparate citizens, the more participation,
cooperation and interaction possible. (This certainly includes
fictitious name ads, about businesses with which those citizens may
interact. They deserve the ability to know with whom they are dealing to
protect themselves.)

The communal information connection is an intangible but critical
benefit provided inpart from publication of legal ads in newspapers. The
income the legal ads generate for newspapers  (for which charges are
limited by state statute) helps them stay in business as tax-paying,
contributing private entities, with strong business and social
contributions to the community.

Until there is a cheap, practical, easily accessible alternative to the
overall contributions provided by newspapers, I hope that they continue
to thrive and provide the valuable services that they do for their
communities.

Florida's newspapers are addressing the need for Internet access to
legal ads and for Internet news and will continue to expand and improve
this effort in the future. To duplicate it with state dollars is
fiscally unwise, unnecessary and minimizes the other benefits that I
noted which are currently provided by newspaper publication.

Thanks for your consideration of my comments, Governor Bush. I greatly
appreciate it.

Sincerely,



Dick Shelton

Importance:	High

Dear President Bush:
 
Janet Reno boasts – The buck stops here! – of burning up all those children in Waco, Texas – not 19 as in Oklahoma City, but 21 – and she receives accolades and admiration from so many, including your brother, Governor Jeb Bush, of Florida.
 
On the other hand, Timothy McVeigh, war veteran and hero, retaliates and is vilified, and the onslaught against me and mine, which commenced years before Timothy McVeigh was ever heard of, continues with no end in sight.
 
How repugnant!  How heinous!  How ghastly!  How hypocritical!  How un-American!  The government, including through its primary propaganda organ, the media, continues to re-define America, in ghastly fashion.  
 
May God have mercy! God bless America! God bless its People… and protect them from this tyrannical monstrous government that has painted itself as, undeniably, Enemy of the People.  
 
My family could not be more representative of what many would like to think that true Americans are expected to be, and yet the government’s onslaught against us rages on, and on…. without the government’s even explaining why, and they dare not explain why!
 
We used to say This is our country, and we want it back!  Now, we say, This is our country, and we want it, possibly a first, as it appears we have never had it, and we refer to incidents such as Wounded Knee – some 200 unarmed men, women and children slaughtered by the government, reportedly to try out their new toy, the machine gun.  These things are the things that the government conveniently refuses to bring up, as it goes about tailoring matters to suit its own heinousness.  
 
Get to the core: send Janet Reno and some others to the death chamber before you even think about pursuing against Timothy McVeigh, himself another one you fear and, therefore, launch a campaign to get rid of.  
 
WHY DOESN’T SOMEONE STEP IN AND REVEAL OUR CASE AND REVEAL WHAT AN UTTERLY FILTHY, FIRMLY-ENTRENCHED, RULE-SUPREME SUBVERSIVE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE IN PLACE?  
 
I DON’T UNDERSTAND IT – IT ISN’T JUST ABOUT PUTTING JUST THE F.B.I. ON TRIAL – LET’S HAVE THE COURAGE TO PUT THE WHOLE, GODFORSAKEN, SUBVERSIVE SYSTEM, TOP TO BOTTOM, ON TRIAL.  IN THE CASE AGAINST THE EXTENDED BLEVINS FAMILY, WE HAVE AN UNPARALLED OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, PARTICULARLY JUXTAPOSED ALONGSIDE THE CASE OF TIMOTHY McVEIGH.  
 
THE GOVERNMENT’S ONSLAUGHT AGAINST US SHOOTS THE GOVERNMENT’S CASE AGAINST McVEIGH SQUARELY OUT OF THE SADDLE, AND THEN SOME!  
 
UNLESS WE SEE EVIDENCE THAT TIMOTHY McVEIGH’S LAWYERS HAVE USED OUR CASE TO THE STRONGEST ADVANTAGE ON BEHALF OF TIMOTHY McVEIGH, I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL COME DOWN AS JUST ONE MORE CASE IN POINT WHERE ONE’S VERY OWN LAWYERS ARE ONE’S VERY OWN WORST ENEMIES!  
 
MOREOVER, IT PROVES THAT THE MEDIA IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PRO-GOVERNMENT, PROPAGANDA MOUTH ORGAN: AFTER ALL, THEY OPERATE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE GOVERNMENT INASMUCH AS THEY OPERATE WITH AN F.C.C. LICENSE, WHICH CAN BE STRIPPED FROM THEM IF THEY DO NOT SAY AND DO ESSENTIALLY AS THE GOVERNMENT OUTLINES, DO THEY NOT?  WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE TO THE CONTRARY?  THE ONLY EVIDENCE I SEE IS PRO-GOVERNMENT, AND I SEE NOTHING SERIOUS THAT IS CON- OR THAT EVEN SO MUCH AS CALLS THE GOVERNMENT INTO ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL ACCOUNTABILITY.  THE MEDIA IS AFRAID OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID OF TIMOTHY McVEIGH AND MY FATHER ROBERT F. BLEVINS AND HIS, WHICH INCLUDES OF COURSE, MYSELF AND MINE.  
 
DO YOU, LIKE YOUR BROTHER, THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND TO MINE IS JUST FINE?

p.s. It seems more than an appropriate time to introduce the October 13, 1999, 11-page letter, below, which I wrote to Jonathan Epstein, Director of Investigations, Office of the Chief Inspector General, Executive Office of the Governor, under Governor Jeb Bush.  
Mr. Epstein had asked me to bring him up to date, and the letter covers some of the very frustrating and fruitless timeline of events and correspondence between April 24, 1999, the date of my son Josiah R. Fornof’s unlawful arrest, and the title date of the letter.  This 6-month timeframe was but a very small portion of the now into its fourteenth year and counting onslaught against this extended Blevins family!  
 
You will note, following the letter below, the disheartening responses subsequently received from Mr. Epstein, and then year after that, from Marty McDonnell, assistant counsel in the Executive Office of the Governor, under Governor Jeb Bush, who has made it very clear to us that he thinks the way we have been and continue to be treated is just fine!

Dear Mr. Epstein:
 

RE:  The Blevins File

(FDLE Case No. 00001GY)
 
This is to provide you with further information about Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) Director of Executive Investigations Jamie McLaughlin’s handling, or rather, as the record indisputably shows, mishandling of Case No. 00001GY, Robert F. Blevins, Complainant.
 

Brief Background

 
As you know, our issues go back to the December 22, 1987, automobile accident in which my father alone was injured and the other driver, Dorothy Wanke alone was charged.  The events which unfolded from there included but are in no manner limited to: a) my parents Robert F. Blevins and Ruth E. Blevins retaining William R. Webb as their attorney on December 24, 1987, b) Dr. Henry W. Hanff’s medical malpractice on December 28, 1987, and c) the State of Florida’s alliance against my parents from the outset.  The State of Florida has remained aligned against us, as most recently evidenced in the FDLE investigation which never happened.  The following represents a fast forward to the events immediately preceding our complaint to Governor Bush and the initiation of the FDLE investigation.  
 
April 24, 1999
 
While I was in Puerto Rico on business with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health, my 18-year old son Josiah Robert Fornof, was arrested under circumstances which, unquestionably, have been orchestrated in the way they have been handled, if not also in the way they happened in the first place.  
 
Josiah remains incarcerated to date, pending trial, on grossly trumped-up charges based on false testimony and charges brought by State Attorney Bernie McCabe and Sheriff Lee Cannon.  Both of these public officials have not only repeatedly refused us equal protection or even due process under the law, they have waged a campaign of aggression against us that began on or before the unlawful, attempted murder raid of October 18, 1994, 10:16 a.m., against Josiah’s grandparents Robert F. Blevins (March 13, 1925 -    )  and Ruth E. Blevins (August 31, 1923 – January 11, 1997).  Both public officials, to date, refuse to so much as answer my lawful questions or provide me with information they are legally obligated to provide.  
 
April 27, 1999 
 
Outraged by this latest manifestation of the undeniable escalation of aggression against our family that began on or before December 24, 1987, when my parents signed on with William R. Webb as their attorney, I did the only lawful thing I knew to do and wrote a letter to Sheriff Lee Cannon expressing my outrage and demanding his release of my son.  Sheriff Cannon had repeatedly betrayed the trust my father Robert F. Blevins, my sister Connie Cieszynski and I had placed in him personally at the February 3, 1995 meeting with him in his office – audiotaped by consent of all present (evidence available upon request for a meaningful, full-blown investigation).  
 
My letter was hand delivered to the sheriff’s office by a messenger on the title date.  Both the receptionist M. Ludecker, and the sheriff’s attorney Mike Randall refused to sign a copy indicating receipt of the letter.  Randall said the only way it would be signed for was if it was sent certified.  I never did send it certified, but Cannon did acknowledge receipt of the letter.  
 
May 3, 1999 
 
I sent a second letter to Sheriff Cannon, which would have reached him May 5, 1999, at the latest.  Cannon ignored this letter and responded to my first one in a letter postmarked May 6, 1999, but dated April 30, 1999.  That’s a long time for a letter to sit in a professional office before being mailed.  I received Cannon’s letter on Friday, May 7, 1999.  
 
May 11, 1999 
 
By this time, my father was living in constant terror, including that he would drive back home some night from visiting with me and would pull in to his isolated, nine-acre estate to find a sheriff'’ deputy lying in wait for him, to kill him, most logically by causing him to have a heart attack.  
 
On this date, I contacted Attorney Howard Shifke, an attorney who I knew had at least one suit filed against Sheriff Lee Cannon.  I discussed my own concerns about Cannon, and Shifke was interested enough to schedule an appointment with me for the very next day.  Mysteriously, however, he called back within the hour to cancel the appointment, never did call me back as he said he would.  
 
After that call with Shifke, I found out he had filed another suit against Cannon in federal court, on behalf of a woman I have known for about eleven years, and who is the mother of a good friend of my son Josiah’s.  On July 17, 1999, Josiah’s birthday, the front page of the Metro section of the St. Petersburg Times newspaper ran an article about Shifke saying that he was giving up his license to practice law for five years to avoid disciplinary action by The Florida Bar – the same bar that has protected William R. Webb since 1994.  
 
My parents learned that Webb served on the Bar’s grievance committee until a couple of weeks prior to his being sworn in as judge.  I read the article about Shifke while waiting to visit Josiah.  
 
May 12, 1999 
 
Yet another fraudulent and felonious, so-called “criminal action complaint” was filed against my 74-year old father Robert F. Blevins on behalf of William R. Webb, who sits as judge in the Sixth Judicial Circuit of Florida.  Subsequently, Pasco County Sheriff Lee Cannon’s Detective Jeffrey Bousquet, went to my father’s isolated home, and as he claimed later, could have arrested my father.  Under the circumstances, Bousquet’s mere presence could reasonably be expected to cause my father’s death, a fact well known to William R. Webb, Sheriff Lee Cannon, State Attorney Bernie McCabe and others.  
 
Later that day, I set up a three-way conference call with my father, Bousquet and myself.  The call lasted nearly three hours, approximately from 12 noon to 3:00 p.m.  Well into the call, possibly more than two hours, Bousquet was still maintaining he had cause to arrest my father, whereupon I cited the relevant Florida Statute to him which proved he did not.  Then and only then did Bousquet back off, and the rest of the call was cordial enough. 
 
Bousquet concurred that the complaint was groundless and that even if my father had done what he was alleged to have done, it would have been his constitutional right to do so.  Finally, Detective Bousquet concluded by offering to contact FDLE on our behalf to have someone from there contact me within a couple of days to initiate an investigation into wrongdoing by Sheriff Lee Cannon, State Attorney Bernie McCabe and Judge William R. Webb.  Bousquet never followed through as committed that I can tell, and in fact, he submerged after this and could not be contacted, which is a typical pattern. 
 
Later in the summer, in an unrelated matter, Detective Bousquet’s investigation technique came under scrutiny, as reported in the St. Petersburg Times July 11, 1999, article, “Court’s decision stirs detective’s memories,” and which said: “…this week, with the state Supreme Court overturning a conviction in an unrelated murder case and harshly criticizing the work of Pasco Detective Jeffrey Bousquet and other investigators…” (emphasis added).   
 

May 15, 1999

 
My father had a very upsetting and bizarre experience at the GTE Phone Mart, Gulfview Square Mall, involving former Sheriff Jim Gillum.  My father came straight to my home afterwards, was still shaken and having difficulty breathing, and all the next day he experienced chest pain.  We followed up with a complaint to GTE which committed to investigate the matter and take appropriate action.  That’s the last we heard except that my father’s phone was cut off on July 15, 1999, the same date my father sent a letter to Attorney Roland D. Waller asking him what he was supposed to do with the $41,523.43 check inasmuch as it is tainted with fraud.  
 
GTE told my father he can still call “911” to which my father replied, “You’ve got to be kidding!  That’s about the last place I would feel safe in calling!”
 
May 24, 1999 
 
My father Robert F. Blevins began his letter to Governor Jeb Bush, “This is a letter of absolute outrage – moral, ethical, and legal.”  The letter went on to provide a thumbnail sketch of the past twelve years of our family’s suffering from wrongdoing at the hands of public officials of the State of Florida.  
 
May 27, 1999
 
Pasco County Sheriff’s deputies showed up yet another time at my elderly father’s home when they had no business being there.
 
June 3, 1999
 
Having not received any response to my father’s letter to Governor Bush, I tried again to reach Attorney Shifke, however, he did not return my call.  I decided to try to file a complaint with FDLE in Tallahassee, even though the local Brooksville and Tampa offices had previously told my father in 1998 that they and Sheriff Cannon were one and to complain to them was to complain to Sheriff Cannon himself.  (I believe this is part of what is behind their illogical, premature close out of the investigation before it got started.  FDLE stood to be exposed as well as a host of others.  Fear of exposure goes along with guilt, I would think.  Otherwise, the truth stands to exonerate as much as to expose, does it not?)
 
Investigator Wayne Thompson, in Inspector General Michael McHargue’s office, took my complaint, and I had a couple of conversations with him subsequent to that.  I found him to be very professional, neither patronizing nor discounting my fears.  Had FDLE actually handled the investigation the way Thompson described, I believe a few public officials would be out of office and at least a couple would be facing trial on criminal charges, and the State of Florida would be well on its way to sorting out the problems it has created and exacerbated.  That did not happen, however.  
 
June 8, 1999
 
Final hearing before Judge W. Lowell Bray of Case No. CA 91-2771, fraudulently constructed suit, wherein Bray took my father’s income property and gave it to the felon trespass occupants Alvin M. Laymon and Tammi Laymon.  Alvin M. Laymon had brutally physically attacked my elderly father and my then-minor son Josiah R. Fornof on March 11, 1998, the Sheriff doctored the report, and State Attorney Bernie McCabe refused to prosecute or even to allow the victims to be involved in the process or to enter their statements into the record, even after my letter of appeal (evidence available for a meaningful, full-blown investigation).  McCabe did not even advise either victim of the hearing or investigation until after he had decided to dismiss charges.  Attorneys Mensch, Halkitis, and Bartlett all were involved in this decision, and all appear on William R. Webb’s list of 171 supporters when he ran for judge in 1994.  Attorney Curtis Crider also was involved in the decision.  Ronnie G. Crider, presumably a relative, was a law partner of William R. Webb in Carlson Meissner, P.A.  In fact, Webb himself spent a number of years working as a prosecutor in McCabe’s office.  
 
June 9, 1999
 
My first letter to Chief Inspector General Marcia Cooke, to which she responded via her June 11, 1999, letter to me.  
 
June 11, 1999
 
General Counsel Carol Licko’s letter to Commissioner James T. Moore, FDLE, which states in its entirety, “Enclosed please find a letter from Robert Blevins, received in our office on June 8, 1999, alleging criminal activity by many public officials, including Sheriff Cannon, Judge Webb and State Attorney Bernie McCabe.  Please review the materials and advise whether these allegations constitute a basis for further inquiry.
 
Why did Licko advise restricting the review to these materials?
 

June 14, 1999

 
My second letter to Ms. Cooke, wherein I alleged that the crimes of conspiracy, civil conspiracy, and violations of Florida Statute 825, Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation of Elderly Persons and Disabled Adults, had occurred, and that the victims were my parents Robert F. Blevins and Ruth E. Blevins, as well as my adult disabled brother Brent T. Blevins.  
 

June 17, 1999

 
My letter to General Counsel Carol Licko, outlining some of the disastrous effects on our family members as a result of the actions of those we accuse.  
 
My letter to Commissioner Moore, referencing the June 11, 1999, letter to Marcia Cooke, my father’s May 24, 1999, letter to Governor Bush.  In said letter to Commissioner Moore, I stated, “My father and I have not made our allegations lightly, neither is there any shortage of evidence to support our claims.  Sorting through it all, however, will take some time.  It will also, unquestionably, require a type and level of expertise we do not possess but which I am told is a matter of routine for FDLE investigative staff.  I anticipate FDLE will contact me soon to arrange commencing with the investigation…”
 
FDLE did not contact me.  However, I later contacted investigator Steve Williams.  
 

June 18, 1999

 
I called FDLE Executive Investigations to request a report on the status of the investigation, having heard nothing since my complaint was forwarded there by FDLE IG’s office.  I was told that the investigator would call me back, however, he did not.  Therefore, I decided to submit a written request for an update: 
 
My letter to Jamie McLaughlin, Director of Executive Investigations, FDLE, states in part, “As you know from my correspondence yesterday, my complaint is associated with and runs concurrently with the complaint of my 74-year old father Robert F. Blevins, himself, which includes but is in no manner limited to material presented in his letter to Governor Jeb Bush, dated May 24, 1999.”  (emphasis added)  I go on to request a report on the status of the investigation.  
 

June 22, 1999

 
About 3:00 p.m., I called for a status report, and was put through to investigator Steve Williams who seemed passively hostile from the outset.  I emphasized the need for him to wait for additional evidence we would submit.  After that call, I placed a second one, conferencing in my father.  Together, we emphasized the need for FDLE to not rely on our written letters alone, but to wait for additional evidence we would submit.  
 
Williams seemed unduly concerned about my father’s previous 1998 contact with the Brooksville FDLE office, and seemed unconcerned about my father’s contact with the Tampa office about the same time.  This caused us to speculate about whether Williams worked at the Brooksville office at that time or had some other strong connection which caused him to be concerned about the message that was presented to my father, which was in effect:  “Sheriff Cannon and we are the same, to complain to us is to complain to him.”  The conversation also left us with grave doubts about Williams’ competence and commitment in handling the investigation.  
 

June 23, 1999

 
My father faxed a letter first thing in the morning to Governor Jeb Bush, which started:  
 
Our problem is, and continues to be, that we can find no one willing to give lawfulness a chance.  The seven-page, May 24, 199, letter which I sent you was never intended as anything other than an attention-getter from which to build.  I fully expect to substantiate my allegations toward a meaningful investigation.  Yet, I find my letter has been bounced around and passed along to yet another claim killer, this one being a Steve Williams, of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
 
My father went on to say:
 
Regrettably, your very own staff, following in the footsteps of that of Governor Chiles, shows the same anti-justice syndrome.  Can’t we be assigned someone more like FDLE’s Wayne Thompson who initially took Kimberly’s complaint?  Unlike Williams, he showed sincere commitment that justice be served, as did Inspector General Michael McHargue. 
 
The above-referenced statement was fresh in my mind when you called me about 3:00 p.m.  I believed, perhaps incorrectly, that Governor Bush had assigned you to our case.  That is why I did not sound surprised to hear from you and why I may have seemed somewhat assertive in our initial dealings.  There is a lot to be done, and we have been anxious for some time to get on with it.  I thought that was what you were there to help us do.  Instead, the State of Florida has continued more of the same pattern we have suffered from over the past twelve years.  When will it end?
 
I have enclosed my father’s complete letter.  There is a lot in it, and it would be worth your time, I believe to read it, or to re-read it if you have already seen it.
 

June 25, 1999

 
I called the FDLE Executive Investigations office and was told by a female staff member named Scout that their computer reflected the FDLE had sent us correspondence dated June 17, 1999, and which was probably sent out on June 22nd.  As of June 25th we had not received it, and were alarmed that FDLE was probably trying to prematurely back out, which we have experienced repeatedly from State of Florida entities.
 
My father wrote a letter to Steve Williams asserting strongly:
 
This demand applies to the information that my daughter, Kimberly Blevins, has supplied on the above-referenced matter.  You will use the material supplied to you thus far for the intended purpose, and the intended purpose only: that is, as a preliminary overview, and that is, in no manner to be used as a presentation of my case.
 
The letter concludes:
 
Moreover, the State of Florida’s greatest responsibility is to, as expeditiously as possible, mitigate the consequences to our family regarding the way we have been injured and continue to be injured by the State of Florida.  What I and we need is not tainted money, such as we have been offered, but clean money, such as the State of Florida is obligated to see is furnished, and such as an unduly influenced jury may see fit to award.
 
I also wrote a letter on the same date to Steve Williams outlining specific allegations,  naming individuals, and spelling out some of the devastating effects on our family.  I also said:
 
When I initiated the above-referenced complaint overview on June 3, 1999, I was led to believe that the State of Florida would work with me and my family in putting together materials to form the basis for a meaningful and thorough investigation.  I have since found out from you, as well as from Jonathan Epstein, Director of Investigations, Chief Inspector General’s Office, that my family and I are basically on our own in preparing these materials.
 
Please note that I am more than shocked that, as a witness for the State of Florida, the State will not provide me with legal counsel or even any more than token advice in assisting me with putting together the plethora of materials we have at our disposal to assist you in your investigation.  Especially considering that we are novices, whereas the State has virtually unlimited resources and expertise at its disposal, as well as the primary responsibility for protecting life, liberty and property and prosecuting crime, I view this as a gross aberration.  Further, this is but the latest in a long series of examples of the State of Florida’s denying proteciton and due process to which my family and I are entitled.  
 
I went on to state:
 
We came forward at great personal peril to expose massive corruption in Florida’s Sixth Judicial Circuit.  What you and the State do with these allegations is part and parcel of your responsibility to at least every citizen of the State of Florida, but in no manner thus limited.  You will be sending a message to the nation and the world concerning what the State of Florida is or is not about.  
 
You were copied on this letter at the time it was sent.  
 
Does the Public Corruption Study Commission really want to motivate citizens to blow the whistle on wrongdoer public officials?  Will the State of Florida, likewise, leave these citizens out on their own, or is it just the Blevins / Cieszynski / Fornof family that has been so favored?  It’s appalling and sickening to me that the Commission is going to debate incentives for citizens to do what any citizen should do when the State of Florida has so blatantly and repeatedly turned its back on us, when we have not asked for anything but a meaningful investigation and have done so at great personal risk.  What is going on, really?
 

June 28, 1999

 
Before leaving for Seattle, at 2:02 a.m., I sent you an e-mail calling attention to the State of Florida’s being split wide open to a level of liability I doubt the State has ever seen.  This is more true now than then, and grows with each passing day.  The State’s liability cannot grow less, but it can grow considerably greater, and is, day by day.
 
Jamie McLaughlin wrote his letter to my father – a letter which made no sense whatsoever, logically, ethically, legally, constitutionally, or in any other way:
 
Our office has reviewed your recent letters to Governor Bush as well as the letters your daughter sent to Inspector General Marcia Cook and fowarded to FDLE by General Counsel Carol Licko.  Also, we have reviewed your daughter’s complaint made to Inspector Wayne Thompson in our Inspector General’s office and the complaint made by you to our Brooksville Office in 1998.  Your complaints indicate that you have previously reported your concerns to numerous local, state and federal agencies as well as having them heard in the civil court system.  Finally, you have also spoken to Inspector Steve Williams from my office regarding this issue.  After our review of the leters and the information you provided it has been determined that your complaints do not warrant further FDLE involvement as this matters (sic) appears to be an ongoing civil issue.  It is therefore suggested that you contact a civil attorney should you wish to further pursue this matter.
 
Strike one: FDLE did not wait for the evidence we told them we would send.  Strike two: FDLE violated our rights, including but not limited to under Article I, Section 16, Constitution of the State of Florida.  Strike three: In the foregoing, the State of Florida has demonstrated the grand conspiracy we allege, has it not?
 
My father received the letter July 2, 1999, while I was still in Seattle.  He called me to discuss it, obviously shaken.  And forsaken.  Again.  My father recently asked me, “Kimberly, do you have any idea what is does to a person to know beyond a question that your own government has disowned and disenfranchised you and is set out to destroy you?”  Yes, I think I do know.  Do you know, Mr. Epstein?  If this happened to us, it can happen to anyone, and we are already have a Nazi Germany brand of rule right here in Florida.  What does Governor Bush intend to do about that?  
 
I just returned from another trip where some colleagues from around the country asked me to reveal the topic of the book I am writing.  At length, I told them it was about conspiracy and corruption in the State of Florida government.  Their responses indicated that this information made perfect sense to them and they were not in the least surprised.  Is that the best we can do?  I don’t accept that – either as a citizen or as a fully vested state employee.
 
We have continued to send correspondence to Jamie McLaughlin and to Governor Bush to date.  The only response I have received was a letter dated October 5, 1999,  from Assistant General Counsel Mark Brewer, acknowledging my public records request – which must have been in response to my September 23, 1999, letter to Governor Bush (copy enclosed). 
 
The situation is serious.  Effects upon my family, to date, include but are not limited to:
 
1.      Our family matriarch, Ruth E. Blevins, was tortured to death by and through the State of Florida, public officials who continue to demonstrate just how much they can do to us and others and get by with it.  
 
2.      My 74-year old father lives in daily fear and terror in his own home, never knowing when a sheriff’s deputy or detective may break in and murder him, a well-founded fear.  I had him stay with me for most of the summer.  Labor Day weekend we went down to his property to mow the front meadow.  We had not been there ten minutes before Sheriff’s deputies were cruising up and down the road, and there were “bears in the air” (a police helicopter).  Funny, but we are not laughing.
 
3.      My disabled brother, who is mentally ill, has fallen victim to those we accuse tampering with his fragile mind, including that on June 3, 1998, he attempted to murder our father.  After his release from jail, less than 30 days later and before my father was informed, Brent returned to my father’s home, and as aided and abetted by Deputy J. Flecker, broke into my father’s home and looted it of hundreds and hundreds of dollars.  Sheriff Cannon refuses to accept a complaint, and his staff have even hung up the phone on my father when he has tried to lodge one.  Brent was placed in an Adult Living Facility (ALF) within walking distance of my father’s home, rather than a distant one, and representing the ever-present threat that he will come back and finish what he started.  Now this, my beloved older brother who tied my shoelaces when I was five, and who had been living peacefully with our father and providing him some company and comfort, is completely cut off from his family, forever.  How heinous and heartbreaking can you get? 
 
4.      My next to youngest son turned 19 in jail, awaiting trial in overkill circumstances I have briefly outlined.  He understands there is much, much more at stake than his present case and upcoming trial, and even all that is emblematic of the State’s unrelenting assault on us, “…an American family trying to hold together in a world that is flying apart at the seams.”
 
5.      My 23-year old son Nathan Fornof, a student at the University of Central Florida in Orlando is back home for the time being and has told me that until these matters appertaining to Judge Webb, et al. are resolved he feels he cannot make any plans for the next few years or even make decisions about his life.  This young man, who has battled every day of his life to overcome challenges presented by an obvious birth defect – and has done so admirably and honorably.
 
6.      My youngest son, Zackary Fornof, 14 years old, has been under a doctor’s continuous and watchful care since January, 1999, due in large part to the near-disastrous effects of a Sheriff Cannon false arrest of him at school.  I was told that if my son would just confess to the false allegation (possession of marijuana) that he would be let off easy, with probation. In the aforementioned false arrest, my son was the only one of four middle school students stopped by the law enforcement officer who was forced to lie, face-down in the dirt and to have his hands handcuffed behind him and his backpack searched.
 
I saw this whole situation for what it was – the latest manifestation of the State’s aggression against us – and declared that I had no intention of telling my son to do anything but to tell the truth under oath, let the chips fall where they may.  I added that, furthermore, I intended to challenge the field test run by the law enforcement officer who claimed he found “traces of marijuana” in my son’s backpack, and that I would seek independent lab results.  As if by magic, the whole matter dissolved, including my son’s imminent expulsion from school.  
 
After dropping the matter, Corporal Denney did ask to speak to my son alone, which I allowed as long as it did not constitute anything that would be used against my son.  That was the last time I dared to trust a law enforcement officer.  Corporal Denney collected some information about my son Josiah I believe was later used against him.  
 
I withdrew Zackary from public school and enrolled him in home school in February 1999, for his own protection.  We also found it necessary for the first time in his life to let him know what had been going on to us since he was three years old.  All the grandchildren have always sensed it, however.
 
 
There are other effects, of course, and some I have previously outlined in other correspondence.  I believe the campaign to threaten and intimidate us has expanded beyond our family now that we are so visible and it is not so easy to come at us directly.  It is speculation, but I believe as many as three murders may have been committed to send just such a message to us.  This includes two murders that happened this summer, one immediately after the FDLE complaint reached the Executive Investigations Office and that I have not previously spoken about, and one which I described at length in a letter dated August 24, 1999, to Jamie McLaughlin, and further referenced in a letter to Governor Jeb Bush, in letters dated August 24, 1999, and August 26, 1999, respectively.  The former murder is still listed as unsolved.  In the second one, the cause of death was heart attack brought on by fear, and three minority teens were arrested and charged with the crime.  
 
In an unrelated case, a young man faces attempted murder charges in what looks like a case where he may have been framed.  That young man was formerly a very good friend to my daughter, and the victim was formerly a very good friend to my youngest son Zackary.  The victim reported to my son that the detectives directed her toward picking out the picture of my daughter’s friend, when given the choice of several.  At one point in his incarceration, Josiah was put in the same cell with that young man, who disclosed that all the State’s evidence was flawed and circumstantial, before Josiah warned him not to talk about his case.  
 
I have gotten into the foregoing speculation just so you can appreciate more of the full scope of why we feel a sense of urgency and duty.  It is one thing for us as a family to choose to put our all on the line.  It is quite another to suspect that others may be targeted because we have chosen to take a stand.   Moreover, without a full-blown meaningful investigation, and denied information which would be helpful in understanding what is going on, and information to which we are entitled, we are left to speculate. 
 
My sister Connie Cieszynski attended the first Representative Heather Fiorentino Justice Advisory Council meeting on my behalf last night since I was still out of town.  My sister reports that some of the discussion centered around the fact that it is more or less routine for law enforcement officers to falsify records and manipulate cases, comments made by a couple of council members who appeared very knowledgeable (one an attorney working in the system).  
 
Now, here you have an eleven page letter, and we still don’t have a meaningful investigation. This matter is not going to go away, neither will we be silenced.  If Governor Bush is serious about cleaning up public corruption, why doesn’t he start with the tools he already has?  And why doesn’t he start with a family whose case study can teach the State a lot?  
 
Please advise me what Governor Bush intends to do in light of all the foregoing, and I will know better what I need to do next.  One thing is for sure, I am not going to stop calling attention to the wrongdoing, no matter how high it reaches.  Would you?  
 
Sincerely,

Following is an excerpt from the response, dated November 12, 1999, from Jonathan Epstein, Director of Investigations, Executive Office of the Governor (Jeb Bush)
 
Ms. Blevins, your complaints indicate that you have previously reported your concerns to numerous local, state and federal agencies as well as having them heard in the civil court system in which you currently have civil litigation pending.  Accordingly, this office will take no further action.  Any further correspondence should be directed to the appropriate agency, as that agency would be best equipped to handle any concerns you may have.  
 
Thank you again for bringing these matters to our attention.
 
 
 
Not deterred, we persisted in appealing to Governor Jeb Bush and others: attached is Governor Bush’s last response, dated December 1, 2000, via his agent Marty McDonnell.  It was my public records request for the 75 documents referred to in this letter that has cascaded into the University of South Florida’s unlawful termination of my employment.  I finally sent the check, under protest, on or about May 22, 2001, but have not yet received the requested records.

Subject:	HB-1053

Please veto the subject Bill.

Doug Williams
Clearwater, Fl

Reasons are listed below:

First, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad public policy:

1. HB 1053 creates special property rights for billboards not enjoyed by
other personal property.
2. HB 1053 overturns years of decisions and planning by local
governments
3. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of "carve-outs" for
some
politically powerful areas.
4. HB 1053 is essentially an unfunded mandate that will increase the
cost of
local government.
5. HB 1053 is contrary to the provisions of Article II Section 7 of the
Florida Constitution which require protection of Florida's scenic
beauty.

Second, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is contrary to the
Fundamental
Principles of the Republican Party:

1. The Republican Party believes in equal rights, equal justice and
equal
opportunity for all:
a. HB 1053 creates a new extra privilege for billboards not available to
other types of personal property.
b. HB 1053 treats Florida cities unequally because of the "carve-outs"
that
were created for communities with powerful legislators.
2. The Republican Party believes the most effective, responsible and
responsive government is government closest to the people.  HB 1053
overturns local decisions and substitutes "big government" mandates.

Third, HB 1053 should be vetoed because it is bad politics:

1. HB 1053's billboard provisions are opposed by many groups in Florida
which include:
a. The Florida League of Cities
b. The Florida Association of Counties
c. The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs
d. 1000 Friends of Florida
e. American Planning Association Florida Chapter
f. Citizens for a Scenic Florida and
g. Over 20 major newspapers in Florida
2. HB 1053 serves a special interest that has despoiled Florida with too
many inappropriately placed billboards.
3. HB 1053 is contrary to what the majority of Floridians want.  After
all
the ordinances this bill overturns were put in place by locally elected
councils and commissions.
4. HB 1053 is inconsistent with Gov. Bush's previous support for
decisions
being made by local government.

Hi:
 
I just reminded Greg Munson that I haven't heard anything about him helping with Fred Washington.  He's the student of mine who is accused of murder who I know did not and couldn not have done it.  I filed papers with the district court of appeals and county court.  He called me tonight and told me he received acknowledgements.  I asked Greg if I should send him a copy, but he hasn't answered me.
 
Jeb - this may sound strange to you - but I have off the weeks of July 16 and July 23.  Is there anyway that you could arrange that I would be able to spend some time with Fred - at least an overnight visit.  I wouldn't mind if they handcuffed me to him and took anything they wanted as collateral to bring him back.  I just want to get him out of there and talk to him and give him some encouragement.  He's up in Gulf Correctional which is at least 6-8 hours from Broward.  If I were to drive up, I would like to stay overnight somewhere near there.  Like I once told you, I'm the only one who communicates with him.  His entire family doesn't.  He was the perfect student and in my heart I know he's there in error.
 
Thanks!  Hope all is well with you.  I understand that you did sign the sick pay bill for school administrators.  I know you thought about it a lot and want you to know I still love ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pour, Little Rich Girl

There are only two things I’ve ever told foreigners about the United States that they simply refused to believe. The first is that partial-birth abortion is legal in this country. A few years ago, during a public debate on abortion that was then roiling all of Ireland, a Dublin taxi driver told me he didn’t understand what all the fuss was over. I told him that the recent debate in the United States had been focused not so much on abortion in general as on certain late-term procedures. When I explained what partial-birth abortion was, the cabbie flat-out told me I was full of it. The more I tried to convince him that the procedure was actually legal–and, what’s more, actually performed–the more he thought I was one of those anti-American ideologues who don’t realize what a good thing they’ve got, and who invent propaganda to make their country sound like some kind of fascist slaughterhouse. In short, he thought I was lying.

The second instance in which American customs have put me in the position of Ripley’s Believe It or Not concerns our drinking laws. Last Bastille Day, I visited friends in a small town in Normandy. After the fireworks, the entire extended family wandered over to a cafe patio and we all ordered drinks. My friend Guillaume ordered a panaché for his 11-year-old son. I asked him what a panaché was, and that launched us on a 10-minute excursion into utter mutual incomprehension.

"It’s half beer, half lemonade," he explained. "You must have something like it in the United States."

"No, we prefer to drink just beer."

"I mean for kids."

"Well, kids can’t drink in the United States."

"But, say, when they go out to a bar and their father orders a–"

"Kids don’t go into bars."

"Of course not, but if a boy’s with his father and–"

"It doesn’t matter," I said. "It’s against the law for a father to order a beer for his kid."

This is where understanding broke down totally. "No, you see, the child doesn’t order the beer," Guillaume went on, his patience rapidly eroding. "The father–"

"It doesn’t matter," I repeated.

Guillaume called over his older brother Maurice, who had a reputation as the town savant, and explained what we’d been talking about. Maurice did an extraordinary thing: he told me that what I was saying could not possibly be true, and if I actually went back and checked the relevant U.S. laws, I’d find… In other words, he went all colonial on me. He treated me as if I were some savage who misunderstood the hard facts of his own country. It was as if I were a tribesman from Mbonkoland telling a couple of tourists that his country’s leading industry is tin mining, which confuses the tourists, who know the country mines nickel, not tin. The confusion would get resolved when some "old Mbonkoland hand" explained that, in the Mbonkolese languages, "tin" is the word used for any metal. But there was no old American hand around, and no possibility of mutual understanding. 

As the meaning of Barbara and Jenna Bush’s alcohol troubles gets masticated in the press, the key point to bear in mind is the one that most easily gets lost. It’s that there are no customs on Earth more bizarre than America’s alcohol laws. When you think of them, think of suttee, foot-binding, and ritual scarification.

The 19-year-old Bush twins were arrested at an Austin saloon last week for underage drinking. Naturally, there’s no evidence that either of them has an unnatural relationship with alcohol–so the state of Texas has taken it upon itself to provide them with one. Owing partly to a jurisdictional accident–Barbara Bush attends Yale in semi-civilized Connecticut and Jenna attends UT in enforcement-mad Texas–Barbara will probably get off with community service, but Jenna could be in a world of pain. You see, Jenna has a prior conviction for underage drinking. She was sentenced just three weeks ago to community service and alcohol education lessons. And it emerged at the end of last week that Jenna may actually have two prior convictions. There is a 1997 incident on police databases. Because Jenna was a juvenile at the time it has not been revealed whether that incident was an arrest or merely a warning. If Jenna does in fact have a third underage drinking offense on her record, then under Texas’ ridiculous "three strikes" law, she could face a jail term of up to six months. The horrid irony here is that Jenna’s own father not only signed that law but actually agitated for it. 

Almost anyone who thinks for a second about Jenna’s predicament will find himself pulled in opposite directions. The dual sympathies that result resemble those of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. At least they resemble mine. On the one hand, there was simply no way that the American people should have had their constitutional right to choose their president nullified because moralists objected to that president’s having had an affair. On the other hand, the President was in danger of impeachment because he himself had signed a Violence Against Women Act that was an outrage to freedom worthy of the Khmer Rouge. And not just signed it–crowed about it, and belittled those who raised libertarian objections to it. Under the act’s feminist-dictated terms, any woman suing a man for the nebulous "crime" of sexual harassment was entitled to demand under oath his entire sexual curriculum vitae. And that’s just what Paula Jones did. 

Back to Jenna. On the one hand, there is no way that George Bush’s daughter should go to jail for having a drink. (What would make that outcome even more sickening, should it transpire, is that most of the people passing judgment on her–from the cops to the prosecutors to the jury to the judge–will likely have done with impunity exactly what she did.) On the other hand, if she does enter the prison system–a prison system, by the way, that Bush did nothing to make less brutal and degrading–it will be as a result of her own father’s presidential resume-building. 

In both Clinton’s case and Bush’s, it was easy to envision two happy outcomes, one ideal, one passable. Ideal would have been a nationwide reconsideration, led by the President himself, of the idiotic and illogical laws that had brought us to this pass, to be followed by concerted effort to overturn them. Second best would be an exercise of the presidential pardon authority to ensure that, if the law doesn’t apply to the president or his family, at least no one else gets held liable under it. Neither happened in Clinton’s case. Clinton’s strategy was to ignore the people whose lives had been wrecked by his stupid law, and aim at his accusers an all-out smear campaign. (It’s true that some of those accusers were ruthless and unscrupulous–ruthless and unscrupulous enough to use the Violence Against Women act exactly as President Clinton had intended his ruthless and unscrupulous allies to use it.)

Bush has not been ruthless like his predecessor, but neither has his administration exercised much–to use a tough-on-crime shibboleth–"personal responsibility." Bush’s spokesman Ari Fleischer even got on his high horse, in an attempt to bully reporters off the story. "I would urge all of you to very carefully think through how much you want to pursue this," he lectured the press last week. "Any reaction of the parents is parental; it is not governmental. It is family. It’s private and the American people respect that." To which one can only say: No it isn’t! No they don’t! They may say they do, but the American people have persisted in electing Draconian enforcers like George W. Bush. So Fleischer has it exactly backwards. If Jenna Bush risks getting her young life derailed over nothing, it’s because of her father’s insistence that the job of teaching kids to drink responsibly be taken out of parents’ hands, and placed in the hands of government.

Dear Governor Bush,
The citizens of Clearwater desire to maintain the beauty and integrity of our city and our local government has banned billboards from defiling our streets.  Now please help us keep Sparkling Clearwater the way we want it!  Veto the Billboard bill and let the citizens here know you really do support local government and not "Big Brother"  government.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I have been a State Trooper for ten years and a Sergeant for the last four and as a Captain in the U.S. Army Reserve for the last 12 years. In that time I have seen exceptional and not so exceptional leaders, administrators, and managers, and in my opinion I have to say Chief Christopher Knight has what it takes to lead this agency, if given the opportunity to serve and the resources to accomplish the goals and objectives. The moral of the Troopers is low. Low Pay and Manpower are the main reason. Approve a budget to increase our pay and staffing significantly, and give Chief Knight the opportunity to serve, and you will see the Florida Highway Patrol as National Law Enforcement Leaders ACCOMPLISHING our GOALS and REACHING our OBJECTIVES. SERVING THE CITIZENS AND VISITORS TO THIS GREAT STATE. If ever you have questions, feel free to e-mail me: ECLEARYJR@aol.com

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I recommend Chief Chris Knight as the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol. I feel Chief Knight has the youth and charisma to bring this Department and personnel to the next level. I have been with the Patrol since October, 1996 and attended the Academy while Chief Knight was the Academy Cooridinator. During this time I found him to be honest, knowledgable, and professional. Chief Knight has enough time left in his career to implement Department programs and see them through to the end.

Dear Judge Mills:
 
What is going on with this extended Blevins family right here under your very nose has to be of grave local, state, federal and global concern: it is that big, and bigger, in case you had any doubts.  
 
The excerpts, below, make reference to a February 3, 1995 meeting my father Robert F. Blevins, my sister Connie B. Cieszynski and I had with then-Sheriff Lee Cannon.  A transcript of that meeting is attached for your convenience.  You can reach across in the courthouse to Judge Marc H. Salton and get the audio ho'those who support him qualify as "the damage or alleviate the pain.  ly bringing him to court, and then admitting that they CD that goes with this transcript – interesting listening, to say the least -- that, along with a “ton” of other information, including my father’s December 7, 1997 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice.  
 
Sincerely,
Kimberly A. Blevins

p.s. Also attached is my father’s November 3, 2000 letter to Judge Salton.  This was prior to my father’s two appearances in court, (c. November 6, 2000 and December 6, 2000).  The State Attorney subsequently filed a Nolle Prosequi in the matter, which confirms once again how very hard they try to pin some criminal act on my father, and how miserably they fail, including here, falsely bringing charges against my father, and falsely bringing him to court, and then admitting that they had done wrong, which does not remove the damage or alleviate the pain.

Subject: Wounded Knee - U.S. Hypocrisy - Oklahoma City
 
Dear Mr. O’Reilly:
 
The federal government’s execution of Timothy J. McVeigh on Monday, June 11, 2001, if carried out as scheduled, will serve as but one of the latest in a long, unbroken chain of hypocrisy by the U.S. Government: how far back it extends in our history, is unknown to me, but was adequately demonstrated on December 29, 1890 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, when some 200 unarmed Oglala Sioux men, women, and children were massacred by the 7th U.S. Cavalry.  Yet, you and all other media who serve as a propaganda mouth organ for the subversive government that rules supreme, persist in calling the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, with 168 dead (some 32 fewer than Wounded Knee) the “worst case of domestic terrorism on U.S. soil.”  You must agree with the federal government that the 200 unarmed Indian men, women and children at Wounded Knee were, somehow, not law worthy.  You are reminded that there was a second event at Wounded Knee: February 27, 1973, during which:
 
…armed supporters of the American Indian Movement (AIM) seized and held Wounded Knee, demanding a U.S. Senate investigation of Indian problems….The siege ended 70 days later, when the Indians were promised that negotiations concerning their grievances would be considered.  After one meeting with White House representatives and a promise of a second one, the Indians were informed that their treaty grievances should be referred to Congress. No further meetings took place (Funk & Wagnalls, 1990, Vol. 28, p. 9). 
 
You must rationalize that a sharpshooter, federal agent was fully justified in taking out Vicki Weaver in her own home at Ruby Ridge, because after all, the Weaver family was – what is the propaganda phrase you like to use? White separatists – and, therefore, the Weavers were not deemed law worthy!  
 
You must be singing hosannas to the federal government for its siege and massacre of the men, women and children at the Branch Davidian complex, in Waco, Texas, culminating on April 19, 1993: some 80 or so (has there even ever been an accurate count?) slaughtered in tantamount to their own house of worship, because, after all, they were – what is the propaganda phrase you like to use? Cult members – and, therefore, the Branch Davidians, even, or maybe especially, the children and infants in arms were deemed not law worthy!   
 
You must also agree and heartily endorse the federal government’s now-into-its-fourteenth-year assault on the formerly five-, now four-generation Blevins-Cieszynski-Fornof-Stout family whose members all reside in the west of Pasco County, Florida, because after all, the federal government, for whom you and yours in the media serve as a propaganda organ, has deemed that we are not law worthy, because… and here, we find, that the federal government does not even dare so much as offer an excuse for why they have so deemed my parents and theirs, which of course includes me and mine, have been deemed not law worthy!  
 
Who are we?  The following is from my father Robert F. Blevins May 24, 1999, letter to Governor Jeb Bush, a first of many letters, so written and sent in a vain attempt to turn around this subversive government:
 
Our family first set foot on this continent in 1636, at St. Mary’s Maryland with the landing of the Ark and Dove…Throughout the generations, our family has been “salt of the earth,” living simply, yet courageously, even settling many new territories… My wife and I had worked hard in raising our three children, and remained always houndstooth clean, and as much baseball, motherhood and apple pie as such can ever be.  We did not just send our children to church, Little League, and scouts – we took them and participated as leaders and teachers.  We do not ask for anything more than we asked for since before World War II – simply to be treated fairly as human beings, under the Law, or to be compensated by those who have failed to so treat us (pp. 1, 2).  
 
My father, in the selfsame 7-page letter to Governor Jeb Bush, goes on to say:
 
The urgency of the matter at hand demands immediate action.  We are, even at this moment, being systematically disfranchised and annihilated, and there can be no evidence to the contrary.  It involves no less than President William Jefferson Clinton, his appointee Attorney General Janet Reno, United States Department of Justice who consider that murder is not a violation of our constitutional and human rights as United States citizens.  To which I add, if murder is not a violation of human rights, why are we in Yugoslavia or meddling anyplace else in the world under the guise of protecting human rights? (page 2)
 
Sheriff Cannon’s unlawfully based terrorist raids against us have become more or less routine, the first having been conducted on October 18, 1994, at 10:16 a.m. to enable attorney William R. “Bill” Webb to become judge although still legally obligated to my wife Ruth E. Blevins and myself in a December 22, 1987, airtight auto accident claim that remains unsettled to date.  The sheriff’s first raid was carried out by a deputy.  No card or case number was left (case number was furnished a week later, and only after our persistence).  My daughters and I met with Sheriff Cannon on February 2, 1995, to protest, and he responded to our concerns by conducting a second raid on October 15, 1996, at 4:48 a.m. with my wife on her deathbed, when he, himself, was up for re-election.  This time the raid, by stealth and under cover of darkness, was carried out by a sergeant, Sergeant Nagy, as confirmed by Lt. Phyllis Davis, who wanted to take full responsibility for it.  Again, no card or case number were left.  The latest raid was carried out less than two weeks ago, and this time, not by a deputy, nor by a sergeant; but by a detective who would certainly have known how to commit a crime like murder and then cover up his tracks.  Each time, Cannon trots out more and stronger intimidation tactics.  What’s next? (page 2)….
 
Then:
 
All of Sheriff Cannon’s raids to date have a number of things in common, including but not limited to: a) there was no lawful ground or cause for law enforcement personnel to be on my property at all—let alone to be carrying out Cannon’s campaign of terror while they were there; b) the sheriff declined to contact us via the least intrusive means (for example, by phone, fax, or mail, that would have matched the urgency—or lack thereof—of the matter); c) the sheriff committed trespass against us, including through stealth and inflicting terror on my wife and me in our isolated home; d) we allowed no contact – otherwise, I am convinced that we (I) would not have survived, and somebody else would be writing this letter to you, if indeed, anybody at all.  The only urgency for Sheriff Cannon in all of these raids is that he saw (and sees) me and my family as threats to the empire he and his cronies have been building, and there is no shortage of evidence to support the foregoing statement! (page 3)
 
Who is going to step in and stop Sheriff Cannon?  To date, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has declined to intervene, as has the United States Department of Justice.  I find it very interesting that according to Cannon’s web page, “In 1998, he was selected by the U.S. Department of Justice as one of 35 law enforcement administrators from around the world to attend the National Executive Institute.”  Maybe that is where he is learning his intimidation tactics.  Maybe Janet Reno is preparing Sheriff Cannon to Ruby Ridge or Waco, Texas, initialize and exterminate us.  We are fighting for our lives here, and our government, top to bottom, has abandoned and disowned us! (page 3)
 
Some of the concluding paragraphs of my father’s May 24, 1999 letter to Governor Jeb Bush included:
 
What do we expect of you?  We have a most urgent need for the State of Florida to step in and sort out this mess.  We are, after all, just an American family trying desperately to survive and to keep our family together in a world that is coming apart at the seams (page 7). 
 
Beyond that, I think my late wife said it best on May 6, 1992, when she figured, correctly, that they had already murdered her – and speaking what she expected to be her last words to me, she said, “I want you to see that they get what’s coming to them for what they have done to me.”  Her plea was not for personal vengeance – far from it, for she was in no manner a vengeful person – her plea was simply for a justice that she never lived to see.  Indeed, it is beginning to look like I won’t live to see it either, and in the meantime, my grandchildren have grown up under the shadow of all this.  When we began with attorney William R. “Bill” Webb on December 24, 1987, our seven grandchildren ranged in age from 2 to 11.  Now, nearly twelve years later, they are all but grown, and we have added two great-grandchildren.  We are still waiting for justice.  When will it come? (page 7)
 
Now, more than two years after that letter, we are still waiting for justice.  A third great-grandchild has been born a few months ago.  The State of Florida-University of South Florida--which has clearly not only sided with the wrongdoers against us, but indeed, is representing them against us—is in the process of unlawfully terminating my employment after my nearly sixteen years of notable public service in the State of Florida, during which I worked my way up from a clerk position (with only high school and business school diplomas under my belt) to a Faculty Administrator (Director) position with bachelor’s and master’s degrees completed, and working on a Ph.D.  The foregoing to illustrate: What the federal government did to those at Wounded Knee is typical of what the federal government will do to anyone deemed not law worthy, most especially those whose issues are with the government itself.
 
Just yesterday, Governor Jeb Bush, publicly announced that he will run for re-election as governor.  During the brief statements he has made about his decision, he managed to work in that he greatly admires Janet Reno: for what? 
 
You, Mr. O’Reilly, if you have even a tinge of a conscience, what you are doing by aiding and abetting murderers will haunt you eternally: People are slow to grasp, and perhaps even slower to anger, but once The People really become aroused about what this subversive federal government is all about, what happens then, I shudder to even imagine.  
 
Aiding and abetting murderers makes the aider and abettor a murderer, or so I’ve always been told: are you exempt from that, 
Mr. O’Reilly?  I don’t think so, and I don’t think that you think so, but I believe that you feel secure under the shield of this subversive government that has taken over the legitimate government and rules supreme.  Let Jesse Jackson alone long enough to take care of the real problem in this country!  The Government’s murdering cream-of-the-crop, core Americans and not daring to so much as offer an excuse, and not required to offer an excuse!

Kimberly A. Blevins

The following is a recommendation of Chief Jim Lee for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Chief Lee has always demonstrated concern for the rank and file Trooper. In so doing he has always tried to balance the needs of the agency with the needs of the Troopers. "Doing the right thing" involves alot more than what is best for the agency as far as what the political atmosphere allows or is percieved to warrant. Past administrations have oftened failed to recognize that Police organizations should place a high standard in regards to "their" moral conduct. Chief Lee would encourage his staff to be honest and not just be a bunch of "yes" people. It is time that we have an honest, trustworthy leader and I believe that Chief Lee is the only candidate that fits that description.

Chief Larry Austin would work hard and provide the leadership that is lacking in our organization.

As a Bureau Chief he has earned the same respect and is a caring and compassionate person as well.

The BILLBOARD BILL OF HORRORS is a bill that benefits

citizens of Florida.
  
This bill takes away local option and control that has
been put into effect in communities and cities over
the past years.   Individual citizens and communities
have the right to determine their community standards.
This Bill takes away these local rights. 
Additionally, the Republican Party stands for local
rights against arbitrary governmental decisions.

This bill destroys all the gains made to preserve
scenic beauty in Florida.  This Bill allows the
Billboard industry to further visually pollute the
state. 

Thank you for considering my request.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Greetings, I hope everyone takes note of the Trooper's choice for Director. Its important that the rank and file of the FHP believe in the top man. If the Governor or Cabinet place an individual in an important position that Troopers do NOT support, it very well may add to our already distrust of the Florida law makers who decide on our pay each year. Each one of you need to take a firm stand on the FHP and realize the shape it is in. We need to be brought up to the level of other local departments before the State Trooper becomes as endangered as the Manatee. After 15 years of service to the State, I'm a bit tired of watching my co-workers leaving to other departments and making double what I do and more often than not, doing less. Wake up folks! Its time! Thanks for your eyes, and I'll be chating with you next session! Sincerely, Scott Coley 14190 W. SR 84 Davie, FL 33325

Please Veto this bill (HB 1953). It goes against all the local codes we have 
been fighting to reduce the number of billboards in our city. Our local code 
is on our side. This would defeat all our efforts. I'm sure other cities feel

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

To Whom It May Concern; I believe that the Florida Highway Patrol will be changing drasticly in the next few years--ie. the coming mass retirements. I feel that there should be someone who will be around not just for a year or two or three, but someone who will be employed for the rest of their career. I feel this would foster an ethic to try and strive for the best, as opposed to someone who will be Colonel for just a couple of years. I respectfully recommend Chief Chris Knight. Trooper David F. Rodriguez, F-Naples

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I believe that Chief Knight is the person to take charge of the FHP and lead us into the years to come. I came to know Chief Knight as director of the FHP academy and found him to be knowledgeable and capable of doing his job. Furthermore, Chief Knight is personable, and greets other troopers by name. Not many Chiefs or Directors know WHO they lead, just the statistics. I belief that Chief Knight is the man for the job.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

Chief Knight is my number one choice. He has has been in the chief's position proably the longest and is very familuar with the Tallahassee enviorment. He is vey well liked and respected by the Troopers and understands the needs of the patrol. However, if chief knight is selected he must be given the resposibility and authority to select his staff without politcal influence. This is important for this change to work in the best interest of the patrol not for FRED.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I know Chief Chris Knight personaly and have found him to be the most qualified of the candidates. Chief Knight has a very approachable demeanor and projects a positive image of the Patrol. His greatest attribute is that he is not only an effective communicator but also effective listener. I believe two-way communication is the foundation to being an effective leader. This coupled with his knowledge, skills, and ability should be sufficient reasons for selecting him as the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol.

Subject:	CS H.B.1053/S.B.2056 - Transportation Bill (Package)

Dear Governor Bush:
 
It has come to our attention that the Transportation Bill has reached your desk.  
 
I am writing on behalf of the 20,000 members of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs, Inc. (FFGC) that passed the Resolution opposing the billboard language in the Transportation package that you are reviewing.  The position of the Federation has not changed.
 
We urge you to VETO THE TRANSPORTATION BILL.  We implore you to give consideration to the additional requests you received from individuals and other organizations who have called and written urging your veto.   
 
The Federation is very aware of the other contents of this so called "must pass" Bill.  However, the billboard language will cost cities and counties millions of dollars.  It that right?
 
We were horrified to discover the billboard language that was buried into this otherwise important piece of legislation. It is not a fair and just way to have an important issue decided for the people of Florida.
 
Communities across Florida fought hard battles to have ordinances passed that meet their standards for billboard control.  This bill would wipe out their efforts.
 
We urge you to support what is right for the people of Florida by vetoing this bill.  Your action will speak for the principle of 'right' and will make a positive statement to the legislature and the department against taking such an action.
 
Sincerely,
 
Marion B. Hilliard

Thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion with regard to the appointment of a new director. I'm a 24 year veteran trooper, and though I'll soon be retiring, it is very important to me that the Patrol has the best possible leadership. There are some difficult times ahead for the FHP, particularly in the area of staffing and recruitment. I know and have worked with several of the applicants. In my opinion, Chief Chris Knight would be the best choice to lead the Patrol. I have found him to be an intelligent and fair administrator and I know that he has had valuable experience in many areas including operations and training. I've found him to be enthusiastic about the future of our organization, and I believe he is sincere in wanting to improve the Patrol for the citizens of Florida and the Troopers that work the road. Again - thanks for the opportunity to express my views. David M. Rinehart Trooper Troop D - Cocoa

Six St. Johns County state budget requests are among the largest flock of
turkeys Florida TaxWatch has found in 18 years.

 But three others within the county escaped the label, according to a list
released in Tallahassee on Thursday by the private group that analyzes
public spending.

COUNTY CODE ENFORCER BECOMES BILLBOARD TARGET


 James Acosta, supervisor of code enforcement for St. Johns County, isn't
deterred by a billboard on Cafe Erotica property criticizing him.

 The sign says, in the opinion of an unnamed person, that he has cost the
county thousands of dollars in lost lawsuits for using selective
enforcement.

 Cafe Erotica is an adult entertainment center.

COOKSEY'S ANNEX ISSUE BEFORE STATE AGENCIES
COPYRIGHT MORRIS COMMUNICATIONS
Michael Reedstaff biosend email

 The Florida Department of Community Affairs, as well as a host of other
state agencies, will review the effort in St. Augustine Beach to turn
Cooksey's Camping Resort into a neighborhood and annex the site into the
city.

 The state will determine whether it's a good idea to downgrade the land use
of about 90 acres of the 115-acre site from commercial to residential. The
remaining 25 acres would remain commercial.

 The City Commission voted 3-2 Thursday to transmit the land use issue to
the state. Albert Holmberg and Linda Ratz-Broudy dissented.

OUR METROPOLITAN OVERLAY, PART ONE  One of seven in the Region

Hello!  david wiles has sent the following Jacksonville.com story to you.

Comments from david wiles:
Rather than SJC having any present claim to 'distinctive in our deliberate
rural focus' or 'other than another metro swallow" we are simply rolled into
the bedroom Duval category with Clay and now Nassau.  And, as CornerStone
marketers might say, an inevitable suburban fate to be applauded.  "Just
another Suffolk on our version of Long Island," SJC EDC consultant Bruce
Lucker might say.
--------
A truly sad Dense-ity pronouncement for 21st Century NE Florida.

NASSAU NEXT TO CONFRONT LARGE BURSTS OF GROWTH

FERNANDINA BEACH -- More areas in Nassau County look more likeDuval, St.
Johns and Clay counties.

The resemblance is revealing, given Nassau is among the state's most rural
counties, based on the number of people per square mile.

The Home Depot project comes on the heels of the grand opening two months
ago of a new 210,000-square-foot Wal-Mart Supercenter just east of the Home
Depot site, both of which are part of The Crossings commercial and
residential development.

According to plans submitted by Home Depot to Clay County planning, zoning
and engineering officials, the warehouse-size store would back up to the
East-West Parkway, which presently extends only from U.S. 17 to Town Center
Boulevard, but eventually will be extended farther west.

 FLEMING ISLAND -- Home Depot Inc. will begin construction this summer on a
145,320-square-foot store in Eagle Harbor, which will be the home

''It looks like, if all goes well, it should be open by the first quarter of
next year,'' said Don Harrison, a spokesman in Home Depot's corporate

BUT JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, MEMBER OR CHAIR, IT ALL ROLLS BACK THROUGH
SJC KOHNKE
AND NOCATEE 3-2 MAJORITY VOTE WITH JACALONE

Comments from david wiles:
SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE NOCATEE PUD CONSIDERATION THIS SUMMER

PART ONE:
The question of whether St. Johns County Utility or JEA would serve Nocatee
will be decided in July by the state Public Service Commission and should be
resolved before county commissioners make a decision about the Intercoastal
purchase, said Michael Twomey, another Sawgrass Association attorney.

"We think the purchase is not fiscally prudent," Twomey said. He cited a
"mere $300,000 reduction" in price and said a lot of the fees from future
customers would come from Nocatee, "which I'm going to suggest you'll never
get." He also implied a lawsuit could result if the County Commission
supported the St. Johns Utility purchase of Intercoastal.

Commissioners should "wait, negotiate, see what the Public Service
Commission is going to do and briefly analyze your possibility of going to
Circuit Court," he said.
KOHNKE & JACKALONE DUEL OVER JEA & INTRACOASTAL AS PRELUDE TO NOCATEE
UTILITY & JEA VERSUS SJC UTILITY.

Kohnke, who supports the JEA purchase of Intercoastal, accused the county
utility of "lying" and withholding papers from her. With the St. Johns
County Utility purchase of Intercoastal, Ponte Vedra Beach customers will
pay a lower rate than the other customers of the county utility, she said.

"The people in St. Johns are going to be subsidizing Ponte Vedra rates,"
Kohnke said. "That's not going to go on very long. ... You are going to be
paying exactly what [other] St. Johns Utility customers are paying. We do
not want to grow the utility on the backs of customers."

ST. JOHNS OKS $20 MILLION OFFER ON UTILITY COMPANY

 PONTE VEDRA BEACH -- The St. Johns County Commission this week authorized
the county utility department to offer $20 million for Intercoastal
Utilities, a water and sewer company that serves areas of Ponte Vedra Beach.

The department and JEA, Jacksonville's main utility provider, both want to
buy Intercoastal, one of several private utility companies in the area, to
gain customers.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

As the ONLY Florida State Trooper on the selection committee for the next Director of the Florida Highway Patrol, I urge you to select a candidate from within the ranks of the FHP. The 7 applicants that we will interview and make our recommendations from are the 7 highest scoring applicants thusfar, however, the outsider is not the candidate that needs to be the FHP Colonel based solely because of his score (incidently, Sheriff Lancaster is in the #4 position out of the final 7). As of this writing, I can only guess as to who the names are going to be in the final recommendations (I am only one person in a panel of 6) but I can assure you of this, the highest caliber, ethically strong, and qualified individuals presented to you from within our Department must be considered and chosen to lead the FHP into the future. I am confident that whoever is recommended to you from within our Department will be the best person for the job. Your task is easy, you have to pick one person from a list that we supply you, our job is the difficult one, we have to compile the list! Remember, "Troopers like to be led by Troopers".

Although I feel that there are many quailfied candidates, I personally feel that Chief Chris Knight has the vision to lead the Patrol into the future. I have worked for him as a supervisor for over 4 years and I find him to be knowledgeable and intelligent. I feel that he has great integrity and balances his loyalty between both the members of the patrol and the Division itself. It is my understanding that he has approximately 10 years left before his retirement which I feel is critical for the stability of our Division. The drop will be a long term problem and Chief Knight will have the longevity to deal with the many problems the drop will have the FHP mission. Thanks for your time, Sgt. William T.

Furthermore, his criteria makes no mention of fiscal prudence and that tells me he is big buffoon.  If he were serious about this tax watch bullshit, he would look at whether or not an application of funding saves tax payer dollars.  And that is not even mentioned.

Nora, you and a thousand others misunderstand what taxwatch does. Member projects aren't bad. It is a question of whether they receive the scrutiny that is essential to efficiently run government. 
 
You and many others would get real hot and bothered if we created an income tax. That will be the result of a generation of well intended projects being funded.

I really don't like this guy.  I think he's very disingenuous and I don't think he does his own research.  If he puts Serenity House on his turkey watch list again, he's going to have to put up with me and  it won't be pretty.  If he did do his own research he would see that some of his so called "turkeys" save tax payer dollars.  But I don't think he really cares about that.  All he does is keep himself employed.  He does far more harm than good!

TaxWatch Finds More Budget 'turkeys' Than Ever Before
By Jackie Hallifax Associated Press Writer 
Published: Jun 7, 2001 



TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida TaxWatch found more budget "turkeys" this year than ever before - more than 500 projects costing nearly $300 million - the private group's president said Thursday. 

That's enough to hire 10,000 new teachers or provide the community services needed by 50,000 elderly people to stay out of nursing homes, said Dominic Calabro, the group's head. 


"Despite an extraordinarily tight budget for core functions of state government, including education and services for seniors, Florida lawmakers served up a turkey feast," Calabro said. 


"We just wish they had been a little more conservative and conscientious." 


The main criteria of a TaxWatch turkey is a budget project that does not go through the review process set up by state lawmakers. 


It can also be a lower-ranked project that is funded over a higher-ranked project or a local project that gets state money even though it doesn't have much local funding support. 


The turkeys identified by TaxWatch run the gamut: special school programs, university construction projects, shelters and advocacy programs for children and victims, basic health programs, mental health clinics, drug-treatment programs, services for the elderly, camps for troubled teens, wastewater treatment facilities, road projects and museums. 


Legislative leaders - including the House speaker, Senate president and chairs of the various appropriations committees - "absolutely" enjoy an advantage when it comes to getting local projects in the budget, Calabro said. 


But other lawmakers can develop the political skill to match leaders, he added. However, the power or skill of lawmakers should not dictate what parts of the state get more than their fair share of state money, Calabro argued. 


"We want to make sure that political might does not necessarily make right," he said. 


Lawmakers passed a $48.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Gov. Jeb Bush has until June 16 to veto spending projects. 


"The governor has made his criteria clear and TaxWatch appears to have used that criteria in their evaluation," Bush spokesman Lisa Gates said Thursday. 


In his first two years in office, Bush has not been shy about vetoing projects despite the Republican leadership of the Legislature. The first-term GOP governor has cut even more spending than recommended by TaxWatch. 


Calabro acknowledged that the budget spending criticized by his group is a fraction of the entire budget. But the money is still "hard-earned tax dollars" that should be devoted to the state's most pressing needs, he said. 


TaxWatch has analyzed the proposed budget and issued a turkey list since 1983. Until now, the record year was in 1999, when the group found 526 turkeys worth almost $235 million. 


This year's totals are 528 items worth more than $288 million. 


Calabro, however, said his group has eased up on its definitions and estimated this year's bottom line would have been about $150 million higher if the standards used last year were in place. 


House Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, didn't defend lawmakers. 


"It was irresponsible of us not to cut taxes deeper than we did," he said. 


Lawmakers passed $175 million in tax relief, far less than Feeney wanted. But Senate President John McKay, R-Bradenton, was far more cautious about whether Florida could afford tax cuts this year and originally opposed any cuts. 


McKay has been a staunch defender of community projects getting state funding, arguing that lawmakers are the ones who should be making such decisions. His reaction to TaxWatch's annual list was markedly different than Feeney's. 


"I think it's irresponsible and I think that they have been overcome by their zeal," he said, adding that after looking at the first page of the list he "just threw it in the trash can."

I really don't like this guy.  I think he's very disingenuous and I don't think he does his own research.  If he puts Serenity House on his turkey watch list again, he's going to have to put up with me and  it won't be pretty.  If he did do his own research he would see that some of his so called "turkeys" save tax payer dollars.  But I don't think he really cares about that.  All he does is keep himself employed.  He does far more harm than good!

TaxWatch Finds More Budget 'turkeys' Than Ever Before
By Jackie Hallifax Associated Press Writer 
Published: Jun 7, 2001 



TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida TaxWatch found more budget "turkeys" this year than ever before - more than 500 projects costing nearly $300 million - the private group's president said Thursday. 

That's enough to hire 10,000 new teachers or provide the community services needed by 50,000 elderly people to stay out of nursing homes, said Dominic Calabro, the group's head. 


"Despite an extraordinarily tight budget for core functions of state government, including education and services for seniors, Florida lawmakers served up a turkey feast," Calabro said. 


"We just wish they had been a little more conservative and conscientious." 


The main criteria of a TaxWatch turkey is a budget project that does not go through the review process set up by state lawmakers. 


It can also be a lower-ranked project that is funded over a higher-ranked project or a local project that gets state money even though it doesn't have much local funding support. 


The turkeys identified by TaxWatch run the gamut: special school programs, university construction projects, shelters and advocacy programs for children and victims, basic health programs, mental health clinics, drug-treatment programs, services for the elderly, camps for troubled teens, wastewater treatment facilities, road projects and museums. 


Legislative leaders - including the House speaker, Senate president and chairs of the various appropriations committees - "absolutely" enjoy an advantage when it comes to getting local projects in the budget, Calabro said. 


But other lawmakers can develop the political skill to match leaders, he added. However, the power or skill of lawmakers should not dictate what parts of the state get more than their fair share of state money, Calabro argued. 


"We want to make sure that political might does not necessarily make right," he said. 


Lawmakers passed a $48.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Gov. Jeb Bush has until June 16 to veto spending projects. 


"The governor has made his criteria clear and TaxWatch appears to have used that criteria in their evaluation," Bush spokesman Lisa Gates said Thursday. 


In his first two years in office, Bush has not been shy about vetoing projects despite the Republican leadership of the Legislature. The first-term GOP governor has cut even more spending than recommended by TaxWatch. 


Calabro acknowledged that the budget spending criticized by his group is a fraction of the entire budget. But the money is still "hard-earned tax dollars" that should be devoted to the state's most pressing needs, he said. 


TaxWatch has analyzed the proposed budget and issued a turkey list since 1983. Until now, the record year was in 1999, when the group found 526 turkeys worth almost $235 million. 


This year's totals are 528 items worth more than $288 million. 


Calabro, however, said his group has eased up on its definitions and estimated this year's bottom line would have been about $150 million higher if the standards used last year were in place. 


House Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, didn't defend lawmakers. 


"It was irresponsible of us not to cut taxes deeper than we did," he said. 


Lawmakers passed $175 million in tax relief, far less than Feeney wanted. But Senate President John McKay, R-Bradenton, was far more cautious about whether Florida could afford tax cuts this year and originally opposed any cuts. 


McKay has been a staunch defender of community projects getting state funding, arguing that lawmakers are the ones who should be making such decisions. His reaction to TaxWatch's annual list was markedly different than Feeney's. 


"I think it's irresponsible and I think that they have been overcome by their zeal," he said, adding that after looking at the first page of the list he "just threw it in the trash can."

Dear Governor,

As a republican in Walton County, I ask that you veto any provision of bill
1053 that would apply to Walton County. One of the largest public interest
(primarily republican) groups in this County has spent years implementing
community supported signage criteria that would be gutted by this bill. We
support the local criteria.

In addition, as Executive Vice President of the Howard Group which is the
owner and developer of Silver Sands Factory Outlet Stores, one of the
largest factory outlet center in the United States, I can tell you with
certainly that a proliferation of non locally regulated bill boards in
Walton County would be highly detrimental to our business and this
communnity.

Governor Bush:  (Jeb) 

The purpose of this letter is to request your support of the 
establishment of a School of Chiropractic Medicine at the Panama City 
branch campus of Florida State University.  Please allow me the 
opportunity to provide you with the history of this project. 

Having been first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 
1978 and re-elected subsequently until 2000, I've seen countless 
educational programs developed during my time in public office. 

In 1979, I served on the first Postsecondary Education Planning 
Commission, while also on the Florida House committee on Higher 
Education.  In this service, I came to understand the planning process 
involved with trying to meet the educational needs of our state. 

This experience was invaluable as I worked with the Florida Chiropractic 
Association to raise over one million dollars for the $1.75 million 
endowment for a Chair in Chiropractic and Biomechanical Research at FSU. 

In our effort to fund this project, it became apparent to all involved 
that Florida was in dire need of additional chiropractic education. 

For example, the chiropractic profession treats over 30% of the minority 
population in Florida, yet only 5% of providers are minorities. 

This disturbing fact stems from the prohibitive costs of and limited 
access to chiropractic education.  This leaves Florida students with no 
choice other than to leave the state to pursue a chiropractic education 
at a private college. 

Going in, I realized establishing a chiropractic college would be a 
substantial challenge.  Initially, I approached the legislative 
leadership and was given their support with the caveat that the project 
needed to go though the proper process. 

Eventually, a study of the need for and the feasibility of a school of 
chiropractic medicine at Florida State University was budgeted by the 
Legislature and conducted by the Board of Regents and the Postsecondary 
Education Planning Commission. 

The findings of the report were very supportive of the goal of a public 
school of chiropractic medicine at FSU. 

After receiving this report, the Legislature informed us of the need for 
an Implementation Plan for the School of Chiropractic Medicine Education 
at Florida State University.  Subsequently, additional money was 
budgeted in the General Appropriations bill for a study to be completed 
by MGT of America, Inc. 

Essentially, this study clearly demonstrated the need for the school of 
chiropractic education at a public university. 

This brings us to our current position as we are now at the point of 
seeing this dream come true with the passage of the current General 
Appropriations bill for 2001-2002. 

As for the details of this provision, it's important to know that the 
Panama City campus is currently under-utilized and that there is 
available space at adjacent Gulf Coast Community College. 

Utilizing this space for the chiropractic school offers additional 
opportunities for other students in the science course that will be the 
base of the curriculum. 

Also, with the growth taking place in the Florida Panhandle, such as the 
Water Colors development, the timing is perfect to have these programs 
in place for future students. 

Keep in mind, the PECO dollars that will be used will be spread across 
several programs, not just the chiropractic program.  The school of 
chiropractic medicine will be able to take advantage of many existing 
resources. 

There are also other positive, larger issues at work here because the 
time has come for the first public school of chiropractic medicine in 
Florida. 

Our profession -- the second largest group of physicians in the United 
States -- is very cost effective to the people we serve.  For example, 
at a time when the Florida Medicaid budget has soared, the portion 
dedicated for chiropractic is within budget. 

This is just one example of why we need more chiropractic physicians, 
especially minority practitioners, which the school will be geared to 
serving. 

And I could go on and on with the merits of this request. 

That's why I have spent time with Mike Hansen and John Winn and others 
on your staff to lower the costs involved.  And why I have worked 
closely with President D'Alemberte and Larry Abele at FSU.  (They even 
hosted a Chiropractic Education Retreat on November 20, 2000, which was 
attended by several of the other Presidents of existing out of state 
colleges as well as nationally respected chiropractic leaders.) 

Everyone was supportive of a public chiropractic education at FSU, just 
as I hope you will be. 

In closing, I look forward to returning to the Legislature and serving 
in the Florida Senate.  I further look forward to helping you win 
re-election to your second term as Governor. 

Please do not veto this relatively small amount of money as the costs 
are clearly outweighed by the benefits. 

As Ever,

Governor:
YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Are you certain however, that the compromise DOES NOT ALLOW for a 3rd lane to be turned into a permanent 4th lane after a period of time? Is it certain that it will remain ONLY a 3 lane roadway PERMANENTLY?
Our concern is that this compromise amenable to all groups concerned is not a TRUE compromise but one that will only Forestall the inevitable 4 lane highway.
 
I really am exhilarated as are many of your constituents that you support this compromise IF indeed it is going to TRULY remain 3 lanes on that 18 mile stretch.
 
One last note, at a dinner party at Mr. Woody Weiser's home in late May in Miami, I met Mr. Alberto Codina (for the first time) who was also vehemently opposed to 4laning the stretch. I believe he had had an encounter with Mr. Walter Revell on the subject awhile back. 
 
We spoke at length about this expansion since he had not been fully briefed by Mr. Revell. I was pleasantly surprised to his reaction since not only is he a leading S. Fla builder he seems to me on first impression an intelligent, caring, successful familyman whose opinion I respected instantly; beside the fact that I am aware that you have been business-partners in the past.
 
Well its been very interesting corresponding with you Sir, I hope those questions do not remain unaswered. 
IF you have time to watch on Monday June 11 at 6Pm on NBC channel 6 on the special Eco Watch Report NBC is doing a piece on this story, Jeff Bernside was the project producer.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a current resident of your State and would like to congratulate you in your efforts to develop our State's social and economic structures and your administration's progressive policies.
 
The reason for this note however, is to suggest that in your next runoff you should be aware of two critical issues if indeed janet reno runs for office:
 
1. Based on her last interview with Judy Woodruff (last week) on Inside Politics she stated that if she decides to run she will do so on an environmental platform. This of course will pave the way for the environmentalists and powerful citizens of the Keys to give her their votes if in fact you decide to expand that 18-mile stretch into a full blown highway. 
 
Given my involvement in this project I would like to request that you give your final decision on whether to 4-lane or maintain a safer 2/3 lane roadway careful consideration as the outcome of this project could indeed be one of various sins when falling from grace. 
 
I will support and vote for you to ensure that you win in the next elections however, I find it critical that you pay closer attention to certain environmental issues at stake in our State as well as the educational issues looming darkly over this peninsula. 
 
Janet Reno will ensure that these two hot topics become her strongest political allies and thus use your own policies on these against you.
 
I as well as many Floridians I know would hate to see you loose against this woman on issues that you seem to care a great deal about and would probably be very successful implementing stronger and more progressive legislation if given the opportunity.
 
Please reconsider your position on 4laning the 18 mile stretch as it is a crucial decision affecting not only the quality of life of our local citizens but our only continental reef in this country and our National Marine Sanctuary.
 
Thank you for your time and interest and never, never, never give up!!! (WC)

Nora, you and a thousand others misunderstand what taxwatch does. Member projects aren't bad. It is a question of whether they receive the scrutiny that is essential to efficiently run government. 
 
You and many others would get real hot and bothered if we created an income tax. That will be the result of a generation of well intended projects being funded. 
 
Do you know that Florida has more member projects than all but a handful of states?

I really don't like this guy.  I think he's very disingenuous and I don't think he does his own research.  If he puts Serenity House on his turkey watch list again, he's going to have to put up with me and  it won't be pretty.  If he did do his own research he would see that some of his so called "turkeys" save tax payer dollars.  But I don't think he really cares about that.  All he does is keep himself employed.

TaxWatch Finds More Budget 'turkeys' Than Ever Before
By Jackie Hallifax Associated Press Writer 
Published: Jun 7, 2001 



TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida TaxWatch found more budget "turkeys" this year than ever before - more than 500 projects costing nearly $300 million - the private group's president said Thursday. 

That's enough to hire 10,000 new teachers or provide the community services needed by 50,000 elderly people to stay out of nursing homes, said Dominic Calabro, the group's head. 


"Despite an extraordinarily tight budget for core functions of state government, including education and services for seniors, Florida lawmakers served up a turkey feast," Calabro said. 


"We just wish they had been a little more conservative and conscientious." 


The main criteria of a TaxWatch turkey is a budget project that does not go through the review process set up by state lawmakers. 


It can also be a lower-ranked project that is funded over a higher-ranked project or a local project that gets state money even though it doesn't have much local funding support. 


The turkeys identified by TaxWatch run the gamut: special school programs, university construction projects, shelters and advocacy programs for children and victims, basic health programs, mental health clinics, drug-treatment programs, services for the elderly, camps for troubled teens, wastewater treatment facilities, road projects and museums. 


Legislative leaders - including the House speaker, Senate president and chairs of the various appropriations committees - "absolutely" enjoy an advantage when it comes to getting local projects in the budget, Calabro said. 


But other lawmakers can develop the political skill to match leaders, he added. However, the power or skill of lawmakers should not dictate what parts of the state get more than their fair share of state money, Calabro argued. 


"We want to make sure that political might does not necessarily make right," he said. 


Lawmakers passed a $48.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Gov. Jeb Bush has until June 16 to veto spending projects. 


"The governor has made his criteria clear and TaxWatch appears to have used that criteria in their evaluation," Bush spokesman Lisa Gates said Thursday. 


In his first two years in office, Bush has not been shy about vetoing projects despite the Republican leadership of the Legislature. The first-term GOP governor has cut even more spending than recommended by TaxWatch. 


Calabro acknowledged that the budget spending criticized by his group is a fraction of the entire budget. But the money is still "hard-earned tax dollars" that should be devoted to the state's most pressing needs, he said. 


TaxWatch has analyzed the proposed budget and issued a turkey list since 1983. Until now, the record year was in 1999, when the group found 526 turkeys worth almost $235 million. 


This year's totals are 528 items worth more than $288 million. 


Calabro, however, said his group has eased up on its definitions and estimated this year's bottom line would have been about $150 million higher if the standards used last year were in place. 


House Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, didn't defend lawmakers. 


"It was irresponsible of us not to cut taxes deeper than we did," he said. 


Lawmakers passed $175 million in tax relief, far less than Feeney wanted. But Senate President John McKay, R-Bradenton, was far more cautious about whether Florida could afford tax cuts this year and originally opposed any cuts. 


McKay has been a staunch defender of community projects getting state funding, arguing that lawmakers are the ones who should be making such decisions. His reaction to TaxWatch's annual list was markedly different than Feeney's. 


"I think it's irresponsible and I think that they have been overcome by their zeal," he said, adding that after looking at the first page of the list he "just threw it in the trash can."

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush and the Florida Cabinet In the next few weeks an important job to 1700+ men and women will be determined by you. Many times these men and women's voices are not heard, but in this situation, please consider the messages received from these postings. Chief Knight has great credentials and has served the FHP well. He serves the upper management as well as his subordinates. His leadership through the ranks have shown that his dedication is with the patrol. Also, as you will see in these postings, he is well liked among the FHP personnel. I would like to offer my recommendation for Chris Knight as the next Director of the FHP. I am a trooper with the FHP with the rank of sergeant and have served 18 years. Through the 18 years, on three seperate occasions, I have had the pleasure to be a subordinate of Chief Knight. Please allow the management and line personnel of the patrol to have a voice that is not always heard in this most important process. Thank you for your time.

Subject:	Re: response 18 mile stretch

Governor:
YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Are you certain however, that the compromise DOES NOT ALLOW for a 3rd lane to be turned into a permanent 4th lane after a period of time? Is it certain that it will remain ONLY a 3 lane roadway PERMANENTLY?
Our concern is that this compromise amenable to all groups concerned is not a TRUE compromise but one that will only Forestall the inevitable 4 lane highway.
 
I really am exhilarated as are many of your constituents that you support this compromise IF indeed it is going to TRULY remain 3 lanes on that 18 mile stretch.
 
One last note, at a dinner party at Mr. Woody Weiser's home in late May in Miami, I met Mr. Alberto Codina (for the first time) who was also vehemently opposed to 4laning the stretch. I believe he had had an encounter with Mr. Walter Revell on the subject awhile back. 
 
We spoke at length about this expansion since he had not been fully briefed by Mr. Revell. I was pleasantly surprised to his reaction since not only is he a leading S. Fla builder he seems to me on first impression an intelligent, caring, successful familyman whose opinion I respected instantly; beside the fact that I am aware that you have been business-partners in the past.
 
Well its been very interesting corresponding with you Sir, I hope those questions do not remain unaswered. 
IF you have time to watch on Monday June 11 at 6Pm on NBC channel 6 on the special Eco Watch Report NBC is doing a piece on this story, Jeff Bernside was the project producer.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a current resident of your State and would like to congratulate you in your efforts to develop our State's social and economic structures and your administration's progressive policies.
 
The reason for this note however, is to suggest that in your next runoff you should be aware of two critical issues if indeed janet reno runs for office:
 
1. Based on her last interview with Judy Woodruff (last week) on Inside Politics she stated that if she decides to run she will do so on an environmental platform. This of course will pave the way for the environmentalists and powerful citizens of the Keys to give her their votes if in fact you decide to expand that 18-mile stretch into a full blown highway. 
 
Given my involvement in this project I would like to request that you give your final decision on whether to 4-lane or maintain a safer 2/3 lane roadway careful consideration as the outcome of this project could indeed be one of various sins when falling from grace.

Governor Bush:  (Jeb) 

The purpose of this letter is to request your support of the 
establishment of a School of Chiropractic Medicine at the Panama City 
branch campus of Florida State University.  Please allow me the 
opportunity to provide you with the history of this project. 

Having been first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 
1978 and re-elected subsequently until 2000, I've seen countless 
educational programs developed during my time in public office. 

In 1979, I served on the first Postsecondary Education Planning 
Commission, while also on the Florida House committee on Higher 
Education.  In this service, I came to understand the planning process 
involved with trying to meet the educational needs of our state. 

This experience was invaluable as I worked with the Florida Chiropractic 
Association to raise over one million dollars for the $1.75 million 
endowment for a Chair in Chiropractic and Biomechanical Research at FSU. 

In our effort to fund this project, it became apparent to all involved 
that Florida was in dire need of additional chiropractic education. 

For example, the chiropractic profession treats over 30% of the minority 
population in Florida, yet only 5% of providers are minorities. 

This disturbing fact stems from the prohibitive costs of and limited 
access to chiropractic education.  This leaves Florida students with no 
choice other than to leave the state to pursue a chiropractic education 
at a private college. 

Going in, I realized establishing a chiropractic college would be a 
substantial challenge.  Initially, I approached the legislative 
leadership and was given their support with the caveat that the project 
needed to go though the proper process. 

Eventually, a study of the need for and the feasibility of a school of 
chiropractic medicine at Florida State University was budgeted by the 
Legislature and conducted by the Board of Regents and the Postsecondary 
Education Planning Commission. 

The findings of the report were very supportive of the goal of a public 
school of chiropractic medicine at FSU. 

After receiving this report, the Legislature informed us of the need for 
an Implementation Plan for the School of Chiropractic Medicine Education 
at Florida State University.  Subsequently, additional money was 
budgeted in the General Appropriations bill for a study to be completed 
by MGT of America, Inc. 

Essentially, this study clearly demonstrated the need for the school of 
chiropractic education at a public university. 

This brings us to our current position as we are now at the point of 
seeing this dream come true with the passage of the current General 
Appropriations bill for 2001-2002. 

As for the details of this provision, it's important to know that the 
Panama City campus is currently under-utilized and that there is 
available space at adjacent Gulf Coast Community College. 

Utilizing this space for the chiropractic school offers additional 
opportunities for other students in the science course that will be the 
base of the curriculum. 

Also, with the growth taking place in the Florida Panhandle, such as the 
Water Colors development, the timing is perfect to have these programs 
in place for future students. 

Keep in mind, the PECO dollars that will be used will be spread across 
several programs, not just the chiropractic program.  The school of 
chiropractic medicine will be able to take advantage of many existing 
resources. 

There are also other positive, larger issues at work here because the 
time has come for the first public school of chiropractic medicine in 
Florida. 

Our profession -- the second largest group of physicians in the United 
States -- is very cost effective to the people we serve.  For example, 
at a time when the Florida Medicaid budget has soared, the portion 
dedicated for chiropractic is within budget. 

This is just one example of why we need more chiropractic physicians, 
especially minority practitioners, which the school will be geared to 
serving. 

And I could go on and on with the merits of this request. 

That's why I have spent time with Mike Hansen and John Winn and others 
on your staff to lower the costs involved.  And why I have worked 
closely with President D'Alemberte and Larry Abele at FSU.  (They even 
hosted a Chiropractic Education Retreat on November 20, 2000, which was 
attended by several of the other Presidents of existing out of state 
colleges as well as nationally respected chiropractic leaders.) 

Everyone was supportive of a public chiropractic education at FSU, just 
as I hope you will be. 

In closing, I look forward to returning to the Legislature and serving 
in the Florida Senate.  I further look forward to helping you win 
re-election to your second term as Governor. 

Please do not veto this relatively small amount of money as the costs 
are clearly outweighed by the benefits.

Governor Bush:  (Jeb) 

The purpose of this letter is to request your support of the 
establishment of a School of Chiropractic Medicine at the Panama City 
branch campus of Florida State University.  Please allow me the 
opportunity to provide you with the history of this project. 

Having been first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 
1978 and re-elected subsequently until 2000, I've seen countless 
educational programs developed during my time in public office. 

In 1979, I served on the first Postsecondary Education Planning 
Commission, while also on the Florida House committee on Higher 
Education.  In this service, I came to understand the planning process 
involved with trying to meet the educational needs of our state. 

This experience was invaluable as I worked with the Florida Chiropractic 
Association to raise over one million dollars for the $1.75 million 
endowment for a Chair in Chiropractic and Biomechanical Research at FSU. 

In our effort to fund this project, it became apparent to all involved 
that Florida was in dire need of additional chiropractic education.

Dear Governor Bush:
Although I have not had the opportunity to fully digest the final version of the "billboard" legislation before you for your signature, I believe its effects will surely not enhance "My Florida".  We in Duval County have done much though local legislation to "tone down" the negative effects of billboard advertising while respecting the rights of the billboard owners and their advertisers.  Please don't sign this legislation.  Anything that detracts from the natural beauty of this magnificent State is not a good thing!
Thank you.

Jeb:

I know that you are overwhelmed with appropriation decisions and bills
from this past session.


This issue of the School of Chiropractic Medicine at the FSU Panama City
Campus is very important to me.  It has been through the entire process
and more, the Legislative process, the Board of Regents, the
Postseconadary Education Commission and MGT of America.

As far as I know it was not on the Taxwatch Turkey list for what ever
that's worth.

I have even seen letters of support from at least three of the private
chiropractic colleges, Southern California University of Health
Sciences, New York Chiropractic College and the National University of
Health Sciences.  I don't know if your staff shares these letters with
you, but all were in support for all the reasons that have been stated
to you before.

Minority access to the profession, economic development to the Panama
City area, an opportunity to lower the over-all costs of spiraling
health care costs as we have shown we can do with the Florida
Chiropractic Medicaid Program. The list goes on and on.

Governor,  the PECO dollars that will be needed at the FSU Panama City
site will be used for exactly what they are meant for, offering
educational opportunities for Florida residents.

Is there anything further that you need to allow this appropriations
item to become law? Allow history to be made in Florida by becoming the
first state to offer a chiropractic education in the public sector?

I do hope I will not be disappointed on June 16th.

Dear Governor,

As a republican in Walton County, I ask that you veto any provision of bill
1053 that would apply to Walton County. One of the largest public interest
(primarily republican) groups in this County has spent years implementing
community supported signage criteria that would be gutted by this bill. We
support the local criteria.

In addition, as Executive Vice President of the Howard Group which is the
owner and developer of Silver Sands Factory Outlet Stores, one of the
largest factory outlet center in the United States, I can tell you with
certainly that a proliferation of non locally regulated bill boards in
Walton County would be highly detrimental to our business and this

large billboards of several years ago.

We have also lost sight of our mission.... serving the citizens of this State. The Patrol is experiancing hard times right now in regards to manpower. This has caused morale to hit a low. Most troopers feel that Knight would do the right thing with suspecting he has a hidden agenda. Trust in our next leader will get us through the rough spots.

Thank you Pam. You will be delighted to know that Joanne Morgan, Director of Government Relations of NASA  and one of their Spanish speaking scientist will accompany the  Team Florida Mission to Chile- Argentina.  we are in the process of organizing meetings for her with the top aerospace authorities of  in each country. I believe Spaceport Florida is also going to send a representative although they have not signed up yet. I am going to pass up this news to them to see if we can incentivate them. So hopefully we can get on the ground floor on future opportunities.

A Chilean Space Agency?

Today's issue of the Santiago Times (English language translation of Chile's leading newspaper) contained an interesting story concerning the possibility that Chile could establish a civilian space agency. In November 2000, the Chilean Air Force announced plans to create its own space agency and to send a Chilean astronaut into space by 2005. The Air Force has also asked NASA to allow a Chilean astronaut to join a future space shuttle mission.

The article in the Santiago Times quoted the director of the Center of Space Studies at the University of Chile, Eduardo Diaz, who suggested an alternative. Diaz said: "if Chile is serious about developing a space program, the country needs to create a space agency that is not under the control of the military, as the government and private investors are reluctant to commit funds to what some have described as a prestige project for [the Air Force]."

The story went on to quote Diaz as saying: "we should focus on applying space technology to our own country rather than thinking about outer space, Diaz said. A Chilean Space Agency should be 100 percent civilian. It should implement a program based on the countrys real problems rather than on the wishes of those in uniform."

A Chilean Space Agency should be 100 percent civilian. It should implement a program based on the countrys real problems rather than on the wishes of those in uniform."

Dear Governor Bush

Thank you for your timely response.

As demonstrated by the variety of letters from daily and weekly newspapers
around the state, it is very much a free and open marketplace. It is not our
intention to protect franchises or limit where these ads can be printed, but
protect the peoples' right to know.

This type of legislation will act to limit the value that newspapers serve.

We feel that the means by which the objectionable language in this
legislation got passed was not not in the publics best interest. It is
ironic that an issue involving notice to the public was done in a fashion to
preclude notice of its existence.

As you are aware, businesses come before the legislature in droves looking
for protection. We see the issue as guaranteeing the publics access to our
governments actions. There is no other medium which does so as effectively
and efficiently as local newspapers.

Once notice is published in cyberspace, how will interested parties prove
they were properly notified of an impending action? Imagine battles between
community groups and commissions if notice is lost.

For this and other reasons it is critical that this legislation be vetoed.

Thank you for your thoughtful attention to our concerns.

Jim Bailey

I believe that the counties that can afford to provide support should do so. If children are a priority, then the money will be there. The impoverished rural counties need to be exempted. I also believe that the local match should be the same across the state.

Subject: KidCare local match


Dear Governor Bush,
Hello there!   I wanted to borrow a few minutes of your time to share my
support for line item 227 in 2001-2202 Appropriations Bill that eliminates,
for one year, the local match requirement for eligible children in the
Florida KidCare Program.  As you may know, I was the volunteer chair for the
Tallahasssee Leadership Roundtable over the past year and a half bringing
together diverse leadership interests for the benefit of united community
needs.  Health Care and the barrier of the local match became one of our
four priorities for improvement this past year.  As you know, Florida is the
only state in the country that has a requirement for the local match. More
than half of the counties in the state could not fully participate in the
program because they did not meet their required local 
match.  The local match requirement has been and will continue to be a major
barrier to fully 
enrolling Leon County's low-income, uninsured children in KidCare. The money
identified in the bill to offset the local match is already there, it will
come from a $27 million reserve fund that currently exists in the 
Healthy Kids program.  Thank you for your consideration of support for this
important initiative.   

Thanks too for all that Liza McFadden and Don Pemberton are doing to further
develop your mentoring initiative.  I have really enjoyed getting to know
and to work with both of them.  They and the program are fantastic!!!  I
hope to see you soon.

Susie Busch Transou

Please note that Miami-Dade Emp Zone partially covers the Miami River--hence
my suggestion for stronger consideration.  The Emp Zone also overlaps the
State's Enterprise Zone which, together, could offer up some good stuff for
River-area businesses.  

FYI, I am looking at getting the Miami-Dade Enterprise Zone boundaries
extended (this upcoming session) to cover the entirety of the Miami
River--particularly that in the third/final portion upstream.   The
Enterprise Zone covers only part at present.

Governor 

I wanted to serve on the SBE to bring about constructive change. This is also 
why I seek to serve on the FSU board. As you know my son Casey, who has the 
good fortune to work for you during breaks, attends UVa. They have so many 
recognized programs that FSU should emulate to bring it to the higher levels 
of national prominence. 

Further, there are so many linkages that can be made into the CC and K-12 
systems, like Web-MC, that should be explored by FSU. With a good, engaged 
board it will reach new levels of prestige. I would like to be part of that 
effort. If I cannot serve all the citizens of Florida on the SBE then I would 
like to improve one little corner of the state. I know I am qualified and 
could do the job required at any board. 

The Council for Ed. Policy Research has a great charge if it is truly going 
to be able to do what is listed. I would be concerned that it not get buried, 
(as PEPC often did), 
and be able to truly accomplish what is listed. How will it relate to the 
SBE? Who will chair it? Who will staff it? Who would serve? How will the 
agenda for research and various initiatives be set? Will the Chair interact 
frequently with the SBE? Have a seat at the table so to speak? Will it be 
allowed to be cutting edge, creative and expansive? 

I know you are busy and I have rambled a bit. You know my preference and I 
leave it to you to decide how best to proceed. Who might I best talk to, to 
discuss these questions?

Governor, 
        An issue that we added to the list since we first went over them with you is the funding for the Council of State Governments.  The amount is $223,882 GR.  Florida has paid dues to this organization as long as I've been in budgeting and it was in the Governor's recommended budget because it's been in the base for so long.  No one had raised it as an issue before, so it has just carried forward.  It is a separate line item that can be vetoed if that's what you choose to do.  It's a D.

Line item 1748, project #7; $750,000 

Governor - 

You asked me to look into the details of this project further.  The Miami Watershed Planning project is to develop water quality modeling for two canals -- Snapper Creek (and Cutler Drain.  The objective is to develop a model to determine the water quality in all of their canal systems for storm water management purposes.  State funds have been provided in the past ($100,000 in '00-01; and $250,000 in '99-00).  No federal dollars have been identified, and DEP has ranked this project very low since it's planning dollars, not restoration.  This project was originally rejected by DEP via the Water Advisory Panel but was later re-considered and approved.

Currently, this project is not recommended. 

Miami-Dade was also allocated $1.8m for flood construction projects in the C-4 canal basin (not for canals listed above).  This is part of the $20 million issue appropriated from the CAT fund for South Florida floods.  As you know, we're still working on this one.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a current resident of your State and would like to congratulate you in your efforts to develop our State's social and economic structures and your administration's progressive policies.
 
The reason for this note however, is to suggest that in your next runoff you should be aware of two critical issues if indeed janet reno runs for office:
 
1. Based on her last interview with Judy Woodruff (last week) on Inside Politics she stated that if she decides to run she will do so on an environmental platform. This of course will pave the way for the environmentalists and powerful citizens of the Keys to give her their votes if in fact you decide to expand that 18-mile stretch into a full blown highway. 
 
Given my involvement in this project I would like to request that you give your final decision on whether to 4-lane or maintain a safer 2/3 lane roadway careful consideration as the outcome of this project could indeed be one of various sins when falling from grace. 
 
I will support and vote for you to ensure that you win in the next elections however, I find it critical that you pay closer attention to certain environmental issues at stake in our State as well as the educational issues looming darkly over this peninsula. 
 
Janet Reno will ensure that these two hot topics become her strongest political allies and thus use your own policies on these against you.
 
I as well as many Floridians I know would hate to see you loose against this woman on issues that you seem to care a great deal about and would probably be very successful implementing stronger and more progressive legislation if given the opportunity.
 
Please reconsider your position on 4laning the 18 mile stretch as it is a crucial decision affecting not only the quality of life of our local citizens but our only continental reef in this country and our National Marine Sanctuary.
 
Thank you for your time and interest and never, never, never give up!!! (WC)

	Yes, the St. Johns County legislative delegation submitted this
through the legislative budget request system.  The project has been
reviewed and approved by Children & Family Services.  However, with their
limited capital outlay they are unable to provide program or renovation
dollars.  They will, however, utilize the center as they have no facility at
this time.  All visitations specified through them are taking place in
Jacksonville facilities.  This puts stress on Duval County and means less
visitation time for their local families.

	Kids Bridge has been reviewed by VOCA (Victims of Crime Act) and
funding from them is pending.  The project has also been reviewed and
endorsed by the county commission, local law enforcement, United Way and the
local judicial system.
 	We have received over $118,000 in cash and in-kind donations toward
Kids Bridge.  As a Supervised Family Visitation Center, Kids Bridge will
provide a neutral, safe, homelike atmosphere where children who have been
placed in foster care (or shelters) and families involved in family law
court can visit each other safely.  This approach helps families gain
reunification and, where necessary, provides the legal system with the
feedback needed to reach a well-informed decision on permanent separation.  
	
	Again, thanks!

To The Honorable Jeb Bush - 

Prior to making your decision regarding the Kids Bridge line item of $100,000 
in Special Category 349, please take a moment to learn more about the Kids 
Bridge project and the people behind the project.  I am a young attorney in 
St. Augustine who joined the Junior Service League of St. Augustine several 
years ago so that I could make a difference in the community through 
volunteering.  At that time, the JSL was still working on the St. Augustine 
Lightstation project, but we soon realized that after years of JSL support 
and hard work, the lightstation was finally restored and improving every day. 

Upon the request of Hon. Robert Mathis, Circuit Court Judge, we began looking 
into the development of a family visitation center for our community.   He 
explained to us the dire need for such a facility, as our children who have 
been removed from their homes were making trips to Jacksonville and Daytona 
to try to visit their families.  Unfortunately, these often involved 2 hours 
of travel time for the children who then frequently found that their parents 
were unable to find transportation to the visitation center to see them.   
Although many familles are permitted to have unsupervised visitation, they 
often have no suitable location to spend that time together, resulting in 
weekly trips to the local McDonalds playground, where the parent sat outside 
and merely watched the children play. 

Once we realized the need for the visitation center, we resolved to do our 
best to make it a reality.  We have been laying the groundwork for the center 
which is now known as "Kids Bridge."  We are now closer than ever to 
realizing our dream we have purchased a building in beautiful downtown St. 
Augustine and have been working through major renovations for quite a while.   
The renovations are now close to completion and we hope to open the center 
this fall.   

Mr. Bush, our small group of dedicated women (usually less than 40 active 
members) has been raising funds by cookbook sales, golf tournaments and black 
tie dinners, as well as pursuing corporate donations and celebrity 
recognition.  We will continue our fundraising efforts, however our efforts 
alone will not be able to pay our mortgages, contractors and facility staff.   
We need your help.  Please approve the Kids Bridge line item in Special 
Category 349 so that we can give the families of St. Johns County a better 
chance at reunification.  If you would like to learn more about the Kids 
Bridge project, please feel free to contact me at (904)825-4991 or at 
hssheppard@aol.com.  Alternatively, Representative Doug Wiles knows many of 
us personally and can speak to the Junior Service League's 66 years of 
devotion to St. Augustine and St. Johns County.   

Thank you in advance for your consideration of the Kids Bridge line item.   

Sincerely, 

Holly Sheppard

Dear Ms. Sheppard:  Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush regarding Kids Bridge.  The Governor has asked me to reply.
 
Governor Bush is currently in the process of reviewing all special projects included in the budget.  He is evaluating these projects based upon a set of criteria which he included in his budget recommendations to the legislature last spring.  Kids Bridge will be evaluated along with all projects contained in the budget based upon these criteria.
 
Again, thank you for letting Governor Bush know about the importance of this project.

Jim Bailey has shared the e-mail you sent him.

We by no means are trying to protect franchises.  In fact, in Tampa, Jim has
at least five competitors that publish these notices from small weeklies to
the large dailies.  Their value is not limited in the open marketplace that
they exist in today.

The issue at hand is the protection of the public's right to know.  The
objectionable language in the bill was passed in a manner so as to avoid
public hearing and scrutiny.  If there is so much merit in its substance,
why was it done so covertly?

re: VETO of HB1157

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today to request that you veto HB1157. The language in
the bill pertaining to the waiver of public notice for fictitious name
filings significantly impacts the public's right to know.

If implementation of the other provisions is delayed until next year's early
session, the impact will be minimal. But, the impact on public notice is
virtually irrevocable.

An issue this important should not be passed as a floor amendment in the
last days of session but rather deserves the full attention of the
legislature and deserves to be subjected to the full legislative process. A
veto of this bill would have no impact on existing business and minimal
impact on a new business.

My family has been publishing newspapers in Florida since 1912 and we have
always recognized and embraced technological advances.

Like other publishers I'm not opposed to the internet as a supplement to
printed legal notice. In fact my papers post notices simultaneously on the
internet at no cost.

Bill Gates recently told the student body at Georgetown University when
discussing his book "Business At The Speed Of Thought" that "the internet
was not designed to replace newspapers". We agree.

We need to look beyond the impact on individual business or industry and
focus on a responsible partnership between those charged with keeping the
public informed. This will assure that the public's right to know is not
only maintained but enhanced.

The foundation of peoples trust in government hinges on their leaders'
commitment to keep citizens informed. The passage of this legislation
impinges the source of access to public information. Therefor I urge you to
veto HB1157.

Sincerely

Subject:	VETO OF HB 1157

Dear Governor:

Jim Bailey, with Bailey Publications, noted to me that you had a concern
about newspapers' pending  request of a veto of HB 1157, in that you
believed that government should not be used as a means to protect
franchises whose value would be limited in an open marketplace.

I agree with you...but I also believe that the state should not spend
tax dollars to provide services that are already being provided by the
free enterprise marketplace.

I wanted to mention a couple of things regarding that issue, of which
you may not be aware.

First, the Florida Press Association, which represents Florida's daily
and weekly newspapers,  already has a statewide Internet site on line to
which Florida newspapers are uploading their legal ads
---floridapublicnotices.com---which is available at no charge to the
public.  At this time the newspapers already participating reflect a
combined circulation of 1.4 million. We are adding newspapers to the
site daily, and plan to have most all of the legal ads in the state on
line by the end of the year....at no cost to the public!

Had we had an opportunity to testify on HB 1157 or if the Deparmtent of
State had indicated their interest in this before quietly adding it as
an amendment on another bill, perhaps we could have explained our
program and worked together to ensure the best service for all of
Florida. Unfortuantely we were not made aware of the bill until it was
already passed.

In testimony, however, I would have to tell you that I would have urged
the committee not to adopt this amendment as it is going to cost the
Department of State public dollars to perform a task which is already
being addressed by private enterprise.

The newspaper industry is currently publishing  most all legal notices
in the state now. These can be uploaded to the floridapublicnotices.com
Internet site with the punch of a button, and at  little cost. This
enables those persons who desire to get this information from the
Internet the opportunity to do so, while not depriving the majority who
get such information from newspapers from doing so.

In addition, the newspapers are planning to run standing ads in every
edition in the state continually informing the public of the location
and content of the legal ad website. There is no more effective means
that I know of to make this information more easily available to ALL of
the public. And it is provided by private industry at no cost to the
public.

Secondly, one of the purposes of  publication of legal notices in
newspapers is for historic preservation. The legal ads become a part of
the history of that community and can be retrieved  at later dates to
prove satisfaction of legal requirements, help resolve disputes, for
historical purposes, or for confirmation of inquiries by citizens or
researchers. Newspaper accounts are often used as major sources of
history by writers, researchers and social scientists.

Finally, let me note a personal belief that newspapers, especially in
smaller communities, are the lifeblood for communal information. They
are the entry point in the community's "personal information stream"
from which most citizens get a large portion of  their working knowledge
and information about current events, coming events, local causes,
historical perspective, local commerce, etc. which directly impacts and
lubricates the daily personal and business interaction of those citizens
in that community. The more information about local events that is
easily available to those disparate citizens, the more participation,
cooperation and interaction possible. (This certainly includes
fictitious name ads, about businesses with which those citizens may
interact. They deserve the ability to know with whom they are dealing to
protect themselves.)

The communal information connection is an intangible but critical
benefit provided inpart from publication of legal ads in newspapers. The
income the legal ads generate for newspapers  (for which charges are
limited by state statute) helps them stay in business as tax-paying,
contributing private entities, with strong business and social
contributions to the community.

Until there is a cheap, practical, easily accessible alternative to the
overall contributions provided by newspapers, I hope that they continue
to thrive and provide the valuable services that they do for their
communities.

Florida's newspapers are addressing the need for Internet access to
legal ads and for Internet news and will continue to expand and improve
this effort in the future. To duplicate it with state dollars is
fiscally unwise, unnecessary and minimizes the other benefits that I
noted which are currently provided by newspaper publication.

Thanks for your consideration of my comments, Governor Bush. I greatly
appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Governor Bush,
Please give consideration to all of the request you have received to veto the Transportation Bill because of the billboard provisions. I know this seems like a huge tradeoff, but the reality of the billboard provisions will cost cities and counties millions of dollars. This is not the way legislation should be approved. Burying an unrelated provision into a 'must have' piece of legislation is just not right.
 
Please let the legislature and departments know by your veto of this bill that you will not endorse such actions and will stand by the principles of fairness to the citizens of Florida.

Mr. Silver:  Governor Bush asked that I respond to your e-mail regarding the MAR Jewish Community Center.  The Governor is currently in the process of reviewing the budget and all special projects.

When Governor Bush issued his budget recommendations to the legislature this year, he included a list of criteria which special projects should meet.  One of these criteria is that the project must be within the mission of the state agency in which the project is funded.  The Senior Wellness Project is funded within the Department of Elder Affairs, and the mission of the department is to serve the most frail elders.  It is my understanding that this project may not meet that criteria.  I would appreciate any comments you have in this regard.

To The Honorable Jeb Bush - 

Prior to making your decision regarding the Kids Bridge line item of $100,000 
in Special Category 349, please take a moment to learn more about the Kids 
Bridge project and the people behind the project.  I am a young attorney in 
St. Augustine who joined the Junior Service League of St. Augustine several 
years ago so that I could make a difference in the community through 
volunteering.  At that time, the JSL was still working on the St. Augustine 
Lightstation project, but we soon realized that after years of JSL support 
and hard work, the lightstation was finally restored and improving every day. 

Upon the request of Hon. Robert Mathis, Circuit Court Judge, we began looking 
into the development of a family visitation center for our community.   He 
explained to us the dire need for such a facility, as our children who have 
been removed from their homes were making trips to Jacksonville and Daytona 
to try to visit their families.  Unfortunately, these often involved 2 hours 
of travel time for the children who then frequently found that their parents 
were unable to find transportation to the visitation center to see them.   
Although many familles are permitted to have unsupervised visitation, they 
often have no suitable location to spend that time together, resulting in 
weekly trips to the local McDonalds playground, where the parent sat outside 
and merely watched the children play. 

Once we realized the need for the visitation center, we resolved to do our 
best to make it a reality.  We have been laying the groundwork for the center 
which is now known as "Kids Bridge."  We are now closer than ever to 
realizing our dream we have purchased a building in beautiful downtown St. 
Augustine and have been working through major renovations for quite a while.   
The renovations are now close to completion and we hope to open the center 
this fall.   

Mr. Bush, our small group of dedicated women (usually less than 40 active 
members) has been raising funds by cookbook sales, golf tournaments and black 
tie dinners, as well as pursuing corporate donations and celebrity 
recognition.  We will continue our fundraising efforts, however our efforts 
alone will not be able to pay our mortgages, contractors and facility staff.   
We need your help.  Please approve the Kids Bridge line item in Special 
Category 349 so that we can give the families of St. Johns County a better 
chance at reunification.  If you would like to learn more about the Kids 
Bridge project, please feel free to contact me at (904)825-4991 or at 
hssheppard@aol.com.  Alternatively, Representative Doug Wiles knows many of 
us personally and can speak to the Junior Service League's 66 years of 
devotion to St. Augustine and St. Johns County.   

Thank you in advance for your consideration of the Kids Bridge line item.   

Sincerely, 

Holly Sheppard

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a current resident of your State and would like to congratulate you in your efforts to develop our State's social and economic structures and your administration's progressive policies.
 
The reason for this note however, is to suggest that in your next runoff you should be aware of two critical issues if indeed janet reno runs for office:
 
1. Based on her last interview with Judy Woodruff (last week) on Inside Politics she stated that if she decides to run she will do so on an environmental platform. This of course will pave the way for the environmentalists and powerful citizens of the Keys to give her their votes if in fact you decide to expand that 18-mile stretch into a full blown highway. 
 
Given my involvement in this project I would like to request that you give your final decision on whether to 4-lane or maintain a safer 2/3 lane roadway careful consideration as the outcome of this project could indeed be one of various sins when falling from grace. 
 
I will support and vote for you to ensure that you win in the next elections however, I find it critical that you pay closer attention to certain environmental issues at stake in our State as well as the educational issues looming darkly over this peninsula. 
 
Janet Reno will ensure that these two hot topics become her strongest political allies and thus use your own policies on these against you.
 
I as well as many Floridians I know would hate to see you loose against this woman on issues that you seem to care a great deal about and would probably be very successful implementing stronger and more progressive legislation if given the opportunity.
 
Please reconsider your position on 4laning the 18 mile stretch as it is a crucial decision affecting not only the quality of life of our local citizens but our only continental reef in this country and our National Marine Sanctuary.
 
Thank you for your time and interest and never, never, never give up!!! (WC)

Conchita Sarnoff

I know that taxwatch publishes incorrect information in the newspaper and that hurts agencies in their respective communities.  Substance abuse money is not a turkey it if meets criteria.  And I resent his putting us on the list last year.  He got hold of a flawed DCF review that said we didn't have our match, when in fact we did have our match.  That proves to me that they don't do their own research.  
 
And he himself applied for state money to pay off the mortgage of that old church that taxwatch offices are in.  I don't disagree with a "tax watch" organization who does clean work.  I just think that Dominic Calabro is not doing good work.

Nora, you and a thousand others misunderstand what taxwatch does. Member projects aren't bad. It is a question of whether they receive the scrutiny that is essential to efficiently run government. 
 
You and many others would get real hot and bothered if we created an income tax. That will be the result of a generation of well intended projects being funded. 
 
Do you know that Florida has more member projects than all but a handful of states?

I really don't like this guy.  I think he's very disingenuous and I don't think he does his own research.  If he puts Serenity House on his turkey watch list again, he's going to have to put up with me and  it won't be pretty.  If he did do his own research he would see that some of his so called "turkeys" save tax payer dollars.  But I don't think he really cares about that.  All he does is keep himself employed.  He does far more harm than good!

TaxWatch Finds More Budget 'turkeys' Than Ever Before
By Jackie Hallifax Associated Press Writer 
Published: Jun 7, 2001 



TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida TaxWatch found more budget "turkeys" this year than ever before - more than 500 projects costing nearly $300 million - the private group's president said Thursday. 

That's enough to hire 10,000 new teachers or provide the community services needed by 50,000 elderly people to stay out of nursing homes, said Dominic Calabro, the group's head. 


"Despite an extraordinarily tight budget for core functions of state government, including education and services for seniors, Florida lawmakers served up a turkey feast," Calabro said. 


"We just wish they had been a little more conservative and conscientious." 


The main criteria of a TaxWatch turkey is a budget project that does not go through the review process set up by state lawmakers. 


It can also be a lower-ranked project that is funded over a higher-ranked project or a local project that gets state money even though it doesn't have much local funding support. 


The turkeys identified by TaxWatch run the gamut: special school programs, university construction projects, shelters and advocacy programs for children and victims, basic health programs, mental health clinics, drug-treatment programs, services for the elderly, camps for troubled teens, wastewater treatment facilities, road projects and museums. 


Legislative leaders - including the House speaker, Senate president and chairs of the various appropriations committees - "absolutely" enjoy an advantage when it comes to getting local projects in the budget, Calabro said. 


But other lawmakers can develop the political skill to match leaders, he added. However, the power or skill of lawmakers should not dictate what parts of the state get more than their fair share of state money, Calabro argued. 


"We want to make sure that political might does not necessarily make right," he said. 


Lawmakers passed a $48.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Gov. Jeb Bush has until June 16 to veto spending projects. 


"The governor has made his criteria clear and TaxWatch appears to have used that criteria in their evaluation," Bush spokesman Lisa Gates said Thursday. 


In his first two years in office, Bush has not been shy about vetoing projects despite the Republican leadership of the Legislature. The first-term GOP governor has cut even more spending than recommended by TaxWatch. 


Calabro acknowledged that the budget spending criticized by his group is a fraction of the entire budget. But the money is still "hard-earned tax dollars" that should be devoted to the state's most pressing needs, he said. 


TaxWatch has analyzed the proposed budget and issued a turkey list since 1983. Until now, the record year was in 1999, when the group found 526 turkeys worth almost $235 million. 


This year's totals are 528 items worth more than $288 million. 


Calabro, however, said his group has eased up on its definitions and estimated this year's bottom line would have been about $150 million higher if the standards used last year were in place. 


House Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, didn't defend lawmakers. 


"It was irresponsible of us not to cut taxes deeper than we did," he said. 


Lawmakers passed $175 million in tax relief, far less than Feeney wanted. But Senate President John McKay, R-Bradenton, was far more cautious about whether Florida could afford tax cuts this year and originally opposed any cuts. 


McKay has been a staunch defender of community projects getting state funding, arguing that lawmakers are the ones who should be making such decisions. His reaction to TaxWatch's annual list was markedly different than Feeney's. 


"I think it's irresponsible and I think that they have been overcome by their zeal," he said, adding that after looking at the first page of the list he "just threw it in the trash can."

To The Honorable Jeb Bush - 

Prior to making your decision regarding the Kids Bridge line item of $100,000

Bridge project and the people behind the project.  I am a young attorney in 
St. Augustine who joined the Junior Service League of St. Augustine several

 Governor:
I briefed Colleen today on our new idea for managing the siting of new fiber
optic cables with "More Protection; Less Process."  

I believe it will yield a better environmental result than the original
"corridor" idea we were developing.  It should also be more widely supported
by the industry.  I look forward to providing you all more details later.

For the next Cabinet meeting, I would appreciate a 6 month deferral of this
issue so we can consult with the various interests and develop the new
approach.  Colleen was going to call Secty. Harris to determine if she would
make such a motion.

Please not that this will not have any negative consequences.  There are no
applications for new cable sitings pending or anticipated for the next year.

Thank you,

In reviewing the above-listed names, I suport Chief Larry Austin or Chief Chris Knight for Colonel. The patrol is at it lowest morale level ever and either of these two gentlemen would provide the positive leadership that will re-establish the members pride in their organization.

John S, I think needs to speak with Vivien Himes (305) 673-1209 about what 
happened in the court yesterday -- she cannot only verify what happened with 
Judge Korvick but she can also verify that no judges were present until way 
after 9:30 AM if not much later.

So here we are hearing from the courts saying that they need all this extra 
judges because of the tremendous amount of cases they have and the packed 
calendar - which is NOT TRUE - while they have all the free time in the world 
and little cases on calendar.  So here we are paying a tremendous amounts of 
money for judges for them to just do nothing.

I do know why the excuses of why they do not want a court watch -- they are 
tremendously scared of the TRUTH!

By and by does John S, still have Judge Korvick in his Board?!  Very 
important question that needs to be answered.  

Best regards,

Sofia

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

In throwing my two cents worth into this possible maelstrom of opinion on who is best qualified to lead the Patrol, I think it would behoove the selectors to consider a candidate who has the support and respect of the rank and file in addition to being otherwise qualified for the position. With those thoughts in mind, I respectfully request that the Cabinet and Governor Bush recognize my endorsement of Chief Chris Knight as being a candidate who I believe to be well qualified to direct the Patrol and one who would enjoy the support and respect of the majority of the members of the Patrol.

Honorable Governor Bush;  As a concern citizen and active voter in Dade 
County and as a past Board member of  Children and Family Board, District 
11th, I am very much aware of the critical situation of this very important 
KidCare Program.  I am writing this e-mail to your office hoping that YOU 
DONT VETO THE LANGUAGE IN THE 2001-2002 APPROPRIATIONS BILL that eliminates, 
for one year, the local match requirement for eligible children in the 
Florida KidCare program (line item 227). 
During my last Board Meeting at the Children and Family Office in Miami, we 
were informed that as of June 2000 more than 17,000 children were in the 
waiting list for insurance. 

Governor, Florida IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS THIS REQUIREMENT. 
 This requirement has been and will continue to be a MAJOR BARRIER to fully 
enrolling in our community's low -income, uninsured children in KidCare.   

Our community knows that the money to offset the local match is already there 
and that it will come from a $27 million dollar reserve fund that currently 
exists in Healthy Kids. 

Please Governor Bush, we, at the Hispanic Coalition is asking for you to 
support the "PROVISO LANGUAGE" in the Appropriations Bill that would 
eliminate the local match to KdCare for one year. 

I thank you in advance on behalf of the thousands children and their families 
that are currently in our data as clients that are in need of your support.

Nora, you and a thousand others misunderstand what taxwatch does. Member projects aren't bad. It is a question of whether they receive the scrutiny that is essential to efficiently run government. 
 
You and many others would get real hot and bothered if we created an income tax. That will be the result of a generation of well intended projects being funded. 
 
Do you know that Florida has more member projects than all but a handful of states?

I really don't like this guy.  I think he's very disingenuous and I don't think he does his own research.  If he puts Serenity House on his turkey watch list again, he's going to have to put up with me and  it won't be pretty.  If he did do his own research he would see that some of his so called "turkeys" save tax payer dollars.  But I don't think he really cares about that.  All he does is keep himself employed.  He does far more harm than good!

TaxWatch Finds More Budget 'turkeys' Than Ever Before
By Jackie Hallifax Associated Press Writer 
Published: Jun 7, 2001 



TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida TaxWatch found more budget "turkeys" this year than ever before - more than 500 projects costing nearly $300 million - the private group's president said Thursday. 

That's enough to hire 10,000 new teachers or provide the community services needed by 50,000 elderly people to stay out of nursing homes, said Dominic Calabro, the group's head. 


"Despite an extraordinarily tight budget for core functions of state government, including education and services for seniors, Florida lawmakers served up a turkey feast," Calabro said. 


"We just wish they had been a little more conservative and conscientious." 


The main criteria of a TaxWatch turkey is a budget project that does not go through the review process set up by state lawmakers. 


It can also be a lower-ranked project that is funded over a higher-ranked project or a local project that gets state money even though it doesn't have much local funding support. 


The turkeys identified by TaxWatch run the gamut: special school programs, university construction projects, shelters and advocacy programs for children and victims, basic health programs, mental health clinics, drug-treatment programs, services for the elderly, camps for troubled teens, wastewater treatment facilities, road projects and museums. 


Legislative leaders - including the House speaker, Senate president and chairs of the various appropriations committees - "absolutely" enjoy an advantage when it comes to getting local projects in the budget, Calabro said. 


But other lawmakers can develop the political skill to match leaders, he added. However, the power or skill of lawmakers should not dictate what parts of the state get more than their fair share of state money, Calabro argued. 


"We want to make sure that political might does not necessarily make right," he said. 


Lawmakers passed a $48.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Gov. Jeb Bush has until June 16 to veto spending projects. 


"The governor has made his criteria clear and TaxWatch appears to have used that criteria in their evaluation," Bush spokesman Lisa Gates said Thursday. 


In his first two years in office, Bush has not been shy about vetoing projects despite the Republican leadership of the Legislature. The first-term GOP governor has cut even more spending than recommended by TaxWatch. 


Calabro acknowledged that the budget spending criticized by his group is a fraction of the entire budget. But the money is still "hard-earned tax dollars" that should be devoted to the state's most pressing needs, he said. 


TaxWatch has analyzed the proposed budget and issued a turkey list since 1983. Until now, the record year was in 1999, when the group found 526 turkeys worth almost $235 million. 


This year's totals are 528 items worth more than $288 million. 


Calabro, however, said his group has eased up on its definitions and estimated this year's bottom line would have been about $150 million higher if the standards used last year were in place. 


House Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, didn't defend lawmakers. 


"It was irresponsible of us not to cut taxes deeper than we did," he said. 


Lawmakers passed $175 million in tax relief, far less than Feeney wanted. But Senate President John McKay, R-Bradenton, was far more cautious about whether Florida could afford tax cuts this year and originally opposed any cuts. 


McKay has been a staunch defender of community projects getting state funding, arguing that lawmakers are the ones who should be making such decisions. His reaction to TaxWatch's annual list was markedly different than Feeney's. 


"I think it's irresponsible and I think that they have been overcome by their zeal," he said, adding that after looking at the first page of the list he "just threw it in the trash can."

Subject: Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary



Dear Governor Bush: 

My name is David Coley and I am the Legislative Assistant to Rep. Allan Bense.  I'm writing to you today concerning the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary (FHPA) and the budget item in the 2001 Appropriations Act to standardize weapons.  I understand through talking with Sarah Voyle that you have expressed concern about this provision.

Since Ms. Voyle did not say specifically what your concerns are, I will attempt to briefly explain to you why this funding (which was sponsored by Rep. Bense and Sen. Charlie Clary and approved by DHSMV and FHP) is good public policy.

First, let me tell you that I am a 16 year member of the Auxiliary.  When I applied in 1986, I had to go through the same application process that a "regular" trooper had to go through.  That included physicals, eye exams, and background investigations.  I had to pay for my own training at Chipola Junior College, buy my own uniform (including weapon) and all of the leather gear that is required.  In 1986 that cost me approximately $1,000.

I'm sure that you are aware that the FHPA is authorized in statute (we have full arrest powers while under the supervision of troopers).  Currently, we have approximately 375 members.  Last year our members (male and female) spent over 161,000 hours volunteering law enforcement services to the state of Florida, FHP and the motoring public.  Both Fred Dickinson and Col. Curt Hall will tell you that we provide the equivalent of 100 full time troopers - without pay.

While our primary duty is to ride with a trooper and provide back up and support, we have performed other duties, as well.  Our members assist the patrol every year with the Black College Reunion, bringing in over 100 FHPA personnel to supplement a small FHP staffing, so troopers can stay in their district and do their job.  During the wild fire season three years ago, our members provided crucial staffing that allowed troopers to stay on the road.  During hurricanes, our members patrol the interstate, assisting stranded motorists, so troopers can work traffic crashes and perform enforcement activities.

This year, we had a FHPA trooper save the life of a 6 year old child while patrolling I-95.  The child, who was not breathing, had wrapped and knotted a seatbelt around his neck and engaged the locking mechanism. When the call for help came in, there was not a location given.  The auxiliary trooper, who was the only law enforcement officer on the interstate at that time, began searching for the vehicle and found it literally minutes before the child suffocated.  After calling for help, he went back to the victim and was able to wedge his fingers between the belt and the child's throat to restore breathing.  Ten minutes after the auxiliary trooper arrived, a full time trooper arrived and was able to cut the seat belt.  When paramedics arrived 22 minutes after the original response, they advised that the child would have likely died if the auxiliary member had not been out patrolling that day.

Governor, that is just one story.  We have had "volunteers" deliver babies in the back seat of patrol cars; rescue families from burning buildings; and jump into the Gulf of Mexico and save drowning victims, recover stolen vehicles and stop and detain DUI drivers.  But perhaps more importantly, these are volunteers who not only risk their lives everyday just like a full time officer.  They respond to interstate call boxes and end up changing a tire for an elderly couple, or getting a can of gas for a teenage girl traveling home from an activity.

I'm pretty sure that you don't have a problem with the program itself, but I thought it was important to give you some actual instances of what these "volunteers" do.

I'm assuming that you have a problem with the purchase of the weapons.  Auxiliary troopers (deputies and police officers) are already given authority through statute to carry weapons.  We are trained exactly like "regular" law enforcement officers.  As required by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission we have to qualify twice annually.  In addition, the patrol requires both troopers and auxiliary troopers to demonstrate proficiency in weapon retention.

I mentioned to you earlier that when I was accepted into the program 16 years ago, I was required to purchase all of my equipment, my uniform, gun and leather and pay for all of the application requirements.  That holds true today except for a couple of provisions (the patrol has been able to pay for training and uniform expenses) Since 1994, the Legislature has provided funds to assist members in this endeavor.  Our initial appropriation was for $50,000 (interestingly enough sponsored by Rep. Sally Heyman).  Over the years, I have worked to have that increased to $150,000.

Last year, Rep. Bense and Sen. W.D. Childers, with the approval of FHP, placed an additional $200,000 to purchase the same weapon that troopers use (Beretta 96G 40 cal.) for the auxiliary trooper.  However, there was a glitch that prevented the patrol from utilizing the funds.  The patrol was, however, able to find funds to buy 116 weapons for new members - since during their recruiting period they were told they would be issued the guns. So, the project is already ongoing, it just needs to be completed.

There are two crucial issues here.  First, the weapon used by the patrol is quite expensive (approximately $700) and cannot be readily purchased.  It is specially made for FHP and Beretta will not manufacture the gun until a certain number is ordered.  This prohibits the auxiliary from recruiting, since a perspective member has no assurance that he can begin service after training if he can't get a weapon right away.

Second, auxiliary troopers currently have three types of weapons in the field: a revolver, a 9mm Beretta (the patrol's old weapon) and the 96G 40 cal.  As an issue of safety it is crucial that personnel have the same weapon, so that if there is an incident involving an extended shoot out, officers could share weapons, magazines and bullets.

Since I pointed out to you before, I think you should know that I already own and carry a Beretta 96G.  Several members made a block purchase when the patrol made the transition in 1997.  That would boost my cost of being a member of FHPA to approximately $1,700.  Last year, I volunteered over 1,000 hours working to protect the motorists of Florida.  We do have several members who regularly volunteers up to 3,000 hours.  The average activity for a member is approximately 300 hours a year.

Governor, these guns will be the property of FHP and the state of Florida.  They will be issued to the auxiliary troopers and they will have semi-annual training.  In the over 40 years of the FHPA, there has never been an accidental shooting by our members.  Weapons have been used to apprehend felons, however.

Just last week, Lt. Gov. Brogan was the keynote speaker at our Annual Training Meeting in Orlando.  He can attest to you the dedication of the men and women of the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary.  Before making your decision, I would respectfully ask you to talk to Capt. Tony Allen, your FDLE escorts and other troopers assigned to the Governor's office to discuss the invaluable service we provide to the state.  Additionally (and this may be out of the ordinary), I am available to discuss this with you - it truly is a great program and a win for the state.  From a liability perspective, the use of our personal weapons is already covered, so there is no new burden on the state.  

Sir, I know this letter is long, but I believe you needed to have a complete history of what brought this appropriation about.  I urge you to allow the appropriation to remain in the budget.  I truly believe that if you veto the item a large number of members will transfer to Sheriff's offices or Police Departments which already provide weapons, training, and uniforms to their members.  This will not only add an extra burden to the patrol, but will take a volunteer off the highway that just might be the guy who prevents a 6-year-old child from suffocating because there was no one close by to assist.

Respectfully yours, 

David Coley

Sweeping changes is what is needed in the patrol. In order for progressive sweeping changes to come the old regeme has to finally go. This will take a strong independant leader. Chris Knight is the only one that has what it takes to take on the system and make the changes. Of course the director can only lead so far with Fred Dickinson holding him back. Ask Ron Grimming how well anyone can lead the FHP with Fred holding him back.

Governor Bush,
Please give consideration to all of the request you have received to veto the Transportation Bill because of the billboard provisions. I know this seems like a huge tradeoff, but the reality of the billboard provisions will cost cities and counties millions of dollars. This is not the way legislation should be approved. Burying an unrelated provision into a 'must have' piece of legislation is just not right.
 
Please let the legislature and departments know by your veto of this bill that you will not endorse such actions and will stand by the principles of fairness to the citizens of Florida.

We by no means are trying to protect franchises.  In fact, in Tampa, Jim has
at least five competitors that publish these notices from small weeklies to
the large dailies.  Their value is not limited in the open marketplace that
they exist in today.

The issue at hand is the protection of the public's right to know.  The
objectionable language in the bill was passed in a manner so as to avoid
public hearing and scrutiny.  If there is so much merit in its substance,
why was it done so covertly?

re: VETO of HB1157

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today to request that you veto HB1157. The language in
the bill pertaining to the waiver of public notice for fictitious name
filings significantly impacts the public's right to know.

If implementation of the other provisions is delayed until next year's early
session, the impact will be minimal. But, the impact on public notice is
virtually irrevocable.

An issue this important should not be passed as a floor amendment in the
last days of session but rather deserves the full attention of the
legislature and deserves to be subjected to the full legislative process. A
veto of this bill would have no impact on existing business and minimal
impact on a new business.

My family has been publishing newspapers in Florida since 1912 and we have
always recognized and embraced technological advances.

Like other publishers I'm not opposed to the internet as a supplement to
printed legal notice. In fact my papers post notices simultaneously on the
internet at no cost.

Bill Gates recently told the student body at Georgetown University when
discussing his book "Business At The Speed Of Thought" that "the internet
was not designed to replace newspapers". We agree.

We need to look beyond the impact on individual business or industry and
focus on a responsible partnership between those charged with keeping the
public informed. This will assure that the public's right to know is not
only maintained but enhanced.

The foundation of peoples trust in government hinges on their leaders'
commitment to keep citizens informed. The passage of this legislation
impinges the source of access to public information. Therefor I urge you to
veto HB1157.

Sincerely

I think that if this same grading scale were applied to students you'd have a civil war on your hands.  I wouldn't be happy if my kids had to keep doing better to keep an A.
 
Anyway, I think you should do billboards around the state with your picture that says you are proud of Florida's schools.

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

I am a Traffic Homicide Corporal in Land O'Lakes and appreciate this opportunity to voice my recommendation for our new Director. I feel Chief Chris Knight would make an excellent Director because of his willingness to listen to those working the road everyday yet still maintain the "big picture" of the FHP and its future. I feel he would maintain FHP in the professional manner it currently is, however, he would also had new ideas and changes necessary to move us into a more progressive agency. Thank you for your allowing me this opportunity to voice my opinion.

    June 8, 2001

    Governor Jeb Bush
    State of Florida

    Dear Governor Bush:

    Please support the 2001-02 Appropriations Bill that waives the
Healthy
    Kids local match requirement for one year.

     Last year, 537 eligible low-income children in my home county were
     denied enrollment because our county could not meet the required
local
     match.  The primary reason that the necessary funds were not
available
     was the fact that Healthy Kids could no longer accept contributions
from
     health care providers.   It took five months for the committee to
raise the
     funds required to open enrollment for our children.  To add insult
     to injury legislation passed last June required no local match for
counties that had not
     previously done so.  Children from these counties were allowed to
     enroll all eligible applicants.  The 2000-2001 county
     match was not only inequitable, it unfairly penalized counties
which
     wholeheartedly supported the program in previous years.

     If and when local match is reinstated, please consider the
     following:
     1.  The greatest barrier to raising local funds is the method for
     calculating a county's match:  First, each county is given a
certain
     number of "free" enrollment slots.  To offer enrollment to all
     uninsured low-income children, local match will be required for the

     number of eligible children in excess of the number of
     "free" slots (this number can be expected to increase as more
families
     hear about the program).  The required funds depends on a
percentage
     of the premium for each child (which is subject to change), times
the
     number of children to be insured (which constantly fluctuates),
minus
     the amount that families pay (one child or ten children, the family

     pays $15).  Can you imagine someone asking you for a contribution
when
     they can't tell you exactly how much they will need?
     2.  Another barrier to raising funds is that there is no specific
     county institution, agency, or organization responsible for raising

     the match.  When we say, "the local community" is responsible - who
do
     we mean?  For those counties who have not had to match funds
before,
     who will Healthy Kids contact to inform them of the required match?

     What if the committees in those counties which currently raise
funds
     decide to disband?  Also, as it is now, my home county has no
     organization or institution willing or able to accept and hold
funds
     until they can be sent to Healthy Kids.
     3.   It is said that local match gives local control.  Local match
     does not give local control.  All Healthy Kids program decisions
are
     made by State government and/or by the Healthy Kids Corporation.
     Local counties have no represention on the Healthy Kids Board of
     Directors.
     4.   If this appropriation is vetoed, when and who will be notified

     exactly how much the county match will be?  It is already too late
to
     get commitment for match by July 1, 2001.  If there must be a
match,
     please make sure that the amount is attainable and equitable, and
that
     reasonable time given for fund-raising.

     Thank you very much for your consideration of these matters.

     Sincerely yours,

    Lucie W. Wade

Honorable Governor Bush;  As a concern citizen and active voter in Dade 
County and as a past Board member of  Children and Family Board, District 
11th, I am very much aware of the critical situation of this very important 
KidCare Program.  I am writing this e-mail to your office hoping that YOU 
DONT VETO THE LANGUAGE IN THE 2001-2002 APPROPRIATIONS BILL that eliminates, 
for one year, the local match requirement for eligible children in the 
Florida KidCare program (line item 227). 
During my last Board Meeting at the Children and Family Office in Miami, we 
were informed that as of June 2000 more than 17,000 children were in the 
waiting list for insurance. 

Governor, Florida IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS THIS REQUIREMENT. 
 This requirement has been and will continue to be a MAJOR BARRIER to fully 
enrolling in our community's low -income, uninsured children in KidCare.   

Our community knows that the money to offset the local match is already there 
and that it will come from a $27 million dollar reserve fund that currently 
exists in Healthy Kids. 

Please Governor Bush, we, at the Hispanic Coalition is asking for you to 
support the "PROVISO LANGUAGE" in the Appropriations Bill that would 
eliminate the local match to KdCare for one year. 

I thank you in advance on behalf of the thousands children and their families 
that are currently in our data as clients that are in need of your support.

I really don't like this guy.  I think he's very disingenuous and I don't think he does his own research.  If he puts Serenity House on his turkey watch list again, he's going to have to put up with me and  it won't be pretty.  If he did do his own research he would see that some of his so called "turkeys" save tax payer dollars.  But I don't think he really cares about that.  All he does is keep himself employed.  He does far more harm than good!

TaxWatch Finds More Budget 'turkeys' Than Ever Before
By Jackie Hallifax Associated Press Writer 
Published: Jun 7, 2001 

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida TaxWatch found more budget "turkeys" this year than ever before - more than 500 projects costing nearly $300 million - the private group's president said Thursday. 

That's enough to hire 10,000 new teachers or provide the community services needed by 50,000 elderly people to stay out of nursing homes, said Dominic Calabro, the group's head. 


"Despite an extraordinarily tight budget for core functions of state government, including education and services for seniors, Florida lawmakers served up a turkey feast," Calabro said. 


"We just wish they had been a little more conservative and conscientious." 


The main criteria of a TaxWatch turkey is a budget project that does not go through the review process set up by state lawmakers. 


It can also be a lower-ranked project that is funded over a higher-ranked project or a local project that gets state money even though it doesn't have much local funding support. 


The turkeys identified by TaxWatch run the gamut: special school programs, university construction projects, shelters and advocacy programs for children and victims, basic health programs, mental health clinics, drug-treatment programs, services for the elderly, camps for troubled teens, wastewater treatment facilities, road projects and museums. 


Legislative leaders - including the House speaker, Senate president and chairs of the various appropriations committees - "absolutely" enjoy an advantage when it comes to getting local projects in the budget, Calabro said. 


But other lawmakers can develop the political skill to match leaders, he added. However, the power or skill of lawmakers should not dictate what parts of the state get more than their fair share of state money, Calabro argued. 


"We want to make sure that political might does not necessarily make right," he said. 


Lawmakers passed a $48.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Gov. Jeb Bush has until June 16 to veto spending projects. 


"The governor has made his criteria clear and TaxWatch appears to have used that criteria in their evaluation," Bush spokesman Lisa Gates said Thursday. 


In his first two years in office, Bush has not been shy about vetoing projects despite the Republican leadership of the Legislature. The first-term GOP governor has cut even more spending than recommended by TaxWatch. 


Calabro acknowledged that the budget spending criticized by his group is a fraction of the entire budget. But the money is still "hard-earned tax dollars" that should be devoted to the state's most pressing needs, he said. 


TaxWatch has analyzed the proposed budget and issued a turkey list since 1983. Until now, the record year was in 1999, when the group found 526 turkeys worth almost $235 million. 


This year's totals are 528 items worth more than $288 million. 


Calabro, however, said his group has eased up on its definitions and estimated this year's bottom line would have been about $150 million higher if the standards used last year were in place. 


House Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, didn't defend lawmakers. 


"It was irresponsible of us not to cut taxes deeper than we did," he said. 


Lawmakers passed $175 million in tax relief, far less than Feeney wanted. But Senate President John McKay, R-Bradenton, was far more cautious about whether Florida could afford tax cuts this year and originally opposed any cuts. 


McKay has been a staunch defender of community projects getting state funding, arguing that lawmakers are the ones who should be making such decisions. His reaction to TaxWatch's annual list was markedly different than Feeney's. 


"I think it's irresponsible and I think that they have been overcome by their zeal," he said, adding that after looking at the first page of the list he "just threw it in the trash can."

The following is a recommendation of Chief Chris Knight for Director of the Florida Highway Patrol:

To the Honorable Governor of the Great State of Florida and his Distinguished Cabinet, I am a 15 year veteran of the Florida Highway Patrol and would like to submit my recommendation for the next Director. I served under Chief Chris Knight when he was my Captain stationed at the Palatka Office. I had heard about him long before I met him from other Troopers in the South Florida area. Everything they told me about him was true. He is very charismatic and commands a very professional presence. I always felt good to know that when citizens and other agency representatives had to talk with our Captain, I knew they were going to go away with a professional impression of our agency (which is what I try to exemplify from my dealings on the side of the road). I knew he would not remain in Palatka for long and was destined for better things. He has been all over the State, serving in various capacities but also has been in Tallahassee long enough to know how to run the agency. Chris Knight will not only direct the agency but WILL be an INCREDIBLE representive of the State any time he appears in public. Thankyou for your consideration.

Dear Mike, 

Rest assured that this project does address the needs of the frail elderly 
who come everyday to the JCC with their walkers and private aides. 

The goal of the Senior Wellness Program is to increase the level of fitness 
of the elderly by doing the following: 

     -  Increase cardiac endurance

Subject:	Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary

Dear Governor Bush: 

My name is David Coley and I am the Legislative Assistant to Rep. Allan Bense.  I'm writing to you today concerning the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary (FHPA) and the budget item in the 2001 Appropriations Act to standardize weapons.  I understand through talking with Sarah Voyle that you have expressed concern about this provision.

Since Ms. Voyle did not say specifically what your concerns are, I will attempt to briefly explain to you why this funding (which was sponsored by Rep. Bense and Sen. Charlie Clary and approved by DHSMV and FHP) is good public policy.

First, let me tell you that I am a 16 year member of the Auxiliary.  When I applied in 1986, I had to go through the same application process that a "regular" trooper had to go through.  That included physicals, eye exams, and background investigations.  I had to pay for my own training at Chipola Junior College, buy my own uniform (including weapon) and all of the leather gear that is required.  In 1986 that cost me approximately $1,000.

I'm sure that you are aware that the FHPA is authorized in statute (we have full arrest powers while under the supervision of troopers).  Currently, we have approximately 375 members.  Last year our members (male and female) spent over 161,000 hours volunteering law enforcement services to the state of Florida, FHP and the motoring public.  Both Fred Dickinson and Col. Curt Hall will tell you that we provide the equivalent of 100 full time troopers - without pay.

While our primary duty is to ride with a trooper and provide back up and support, we have performed other duties, as well.  Our members assist the patrol every year with the Black College Reunion, bringing in over 100 FHPA personnel to supplement a small FHP staffing, so troopers can stay in their district and do their job.  During the wild fire season three years ago, our members provided crucial staffing that allowed troopers to stay on the road.  During hurricanes, our members patrol the interstate, assisting stranded motorists, so troopers can work traffic crashes and perform enforcement activities.

This year, we had a FHPA trooper save the life of a 6 year old child while patrolling I-95.  The child, who was not breathing, had wrapped and knotted a seatbelt around his neck and engaged the locking mechanism. When the call for help came in, there was not a location given.  The auxiliary trooper, who was the only law enforcement officer on the interstate at that time, began searching for the vehicle and found it literally minutes before the child suffocated.  After calling for help, he went back to the victim and was able to wedge his fingers between the belt and the child's throat to restore breathing.  Ten minutes after the auxiliary trooper arrived, a full time trooper arrived and was able to cut the seat belt.  When paramedics arrived 22 minutes after the original response, they advised that the child would have likely died if the auxiliary member had not been out patrolling that day.

Governor, that is just one story.  We have had "volunteers" deliver babies in the back seat of patrol cars; rescue families from burning buildings; and jump into the Gulf of Mexico and save drowning victims, recover stolen vehicles and stop and detain DUI drivers.  But perhaps more importantly, these are volunteers who not only risk their lives everyday just like a full time officer.  They respond to interstate call boxes and end up changing a tire for an elderly couple, or getting a can of gas for a teenage girl traveling home from an activity.

I'm pretty sure that you don't have a problem with the program itself, but I thought it was important to give you some actual instances of what these "volunteers" do.

I'm assuming that you have a problem with the purchase of the weapons.  Auxiliary troopers (deputies and police officers) are already given authority through statute to carry weapons.  We are trained exactly like "regular" law enforcement officers.  As required by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission we have to qualify twice annually.  In addition, the patrol requires both troopers and auxiliary troopers to demonstrate proficiency in weapon retention.

I mentioned to you earlier that when I was accepted into the program 16 years ago, I was required to purchase all of my equipment, my uniform, gun and leather and pay for all of the application requirements.  That holds true today except for a couple of provisions (the patrol has been able to pay for training and uniform expenses) Since 1994, the Legislature has provided funds to assist members in this endeavor.  Our initial appropriation was for $50,000 (interestingly enough sponsored by Rep. Sally Heyman).  Over the years, I have worked to have that increased to $150,000.

Last year, Rep. Bense and Sen. W.D. Childers, with the approval of FHP, placed an additional $200,000 to purchase the same weapon that troopers use (Beretta 96G 40 cal.) for the auxiliary trooper.  However, there was a glitch that prevented the patrol from utilizing the funds.  The patrol was, however, able to find funds to buy 116 weapons for new members - since during their recruiting period they were told they would be issued the guns. So, the project is already ongoing, it just needs to be completed.

There are two crucial issues here.  First, the weapon used by the patrol is quite expensive (approximately $700) and cannot be readily purchased.  It is specially made for FHP and Beretta will not manufacture the gun until a certain number is ordered.  This prohibits the auxiliary from recruiting, since a perspective member has no assurance that he can begin service after training if he can't get a weapon right away.

Second, auxiliary troopers currently have three types of weapons in the field: a revolver, a 9mm Beretta (the patrol's old weapon) and the 96G 40 cal.  As an issue of safety it is crucial that personnel have the same weapon, so that if there is an incident involving an extended shoot out, officers could share weapons, magazines and bullets.

Since I pointed out to you before, I think you should know that I already own and carry a Beretta 96G.  Several members made a block purchase when the patrol made the transition in 1997.  That would boost my cost of being a member of FHPA to approximately $1,700.  Last year, I volunteered over 1,000 hours working to protect the motorists of Florida.  We do have several members who regularly volunteers up to 3,000 hours.  The average activity for a member is approximately 300 hours a year.

Governor, these guns will be the property of FHP and the state of Florida.  They will be issued to the auxiliary troopers and they will have semi-annual training.  In the over 40 years of the FHPA, there has never been an accidental shooting by our members.  Weapons have been used to apprehend felons, however.

Just last week, Lt. Gov. Brogan was the keynote speaker at our Annual Training Meeting in Orlando.  He can attest to you the dedication of the men and women of the Florida Highway Patrol Auxiliary.  Before making your decision, I would respectfully ask you to talk to Capt. Tony Allen, your FDLE escorts and other troopers assigned to the Governor's office to discuss the invaluable service we provide to the state.  Additionally (and this may be out of the ordinary), I am available to discuss this with you - it truly is a great program and a win for the state.  From a liability perspective, the use of our personal weapons is already covered, so there is no new burden on the state.  

Sir, I know this letter is long, but I believe you needed to have a complete history of what brought this appropriation about.  I urge you to allow the appropriation to remain in the budget.  I truly believe that if you veto the item a large number of members will transfer to Sheriff's offices or Police Departments which already provide weapons, training, and uniforms to their members.  This will not only add an extra burden to the patrol, but will take a volunteer off the highway that just might be the guy who prevents a 6-year-old child from suffocating because there was no one close by to assist.

Respectfully yours, 

David Coley

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I urge you to veto Transportation Bill 1053. It is fraught with cancerous lesions disguised as special interest favors. The most malignant being the Billboard Industry's attempt to subjugate home rule through the elimination of amortization. Amortization is a legitimate and necessary tool for municipalities to remove visual blight from their urban, suburban and rural landscapes. The fact that privately owned billboards can already eliminate aesthetic landscaping in our public right-of-ways is galling enough, but for the industry to eliminate this mechanism altogether by attaching it to this major piece of legistlation is a true transgression to the citizens of Florida. As you may know, 71% of Floridians consider themselves protectors of Florida's environment and that includes scenic beauty. Rather it be urban, suburban or rural in perspective. PLEASE VETO THIS BILL! It's truely poor legislation designed for one industry while screwing the cities and citizens of Florida.
Thank you for your consideration.

That's popycock! The STO does not want to locate qualified minority firms,
and when they do, minority firms are being held to higher standards and
their abilities scrutinized more than non-minority firms. You have given Mr.

    June 8, 2001

    Governor Jeb Bush
    State of Florida

    Dear Governor Bush:

    Please support the 2001-02 Appropriations Bill that waives the
Healthy
    Kids local match requirement for one year.

     Last year, 537 eligible low-income children in my home county were
     denied enrollment because our county could not meet the required
local
     match.  The primary reason that the necessary funds were not
available
     was the fact that Healthy Kids could no longer accept contributions
from
     health care providers.   It took five months for the committee to
raise the
     funds required to open enrollment for our children.  To add insult
     to injury legislation passed last June required no local match for
counties that had not
     previously done so.  Children from these counties were allowed to
     enroll all eligible applicants.  The 2000-2001 county
     match was not only inequitable, it unfairly penalized counties
which
     wholeheartedly supported the program in previous years.

     If and when local match is reinstated, please consider the
     following:
     1.  The greatest barrier to raising local funds is the method for
     calculating a county's match:  First, each county is given a
certain
     number of "free" enrollment slots.  To offer enrollment to all
     uninsured low-income children, local match will be required for the

     number of eligible children in excess of the number of
     "free" slots (this number can be expected to increase as more
families
     hear about the program).  The required funds depends on a
percentage
     of the premium for each child (which is subject to change), times
the
     number of children to be insured (which constantly fluctuates),
minus
     the amount that families pay (one child or ten children, the family

     pays $15).  Can you imagine someone asking you for a contribution
when
     they can't tell you exactly how much they will need?
     2.  Another barrier to raising funds is that there is no specific
     county institution, agency, or organization responsible for raising

     the match.  When we say, "the local community" is responsible - who
do
     we mean?  For those counties who have not had to match funds
before,
     who will Healthy Kids contact to inform them of the required match?

     What if the committees in those counties which currently raise
funds
     decide to disband?  Also, as it is now, my home county has no
     organization or institution willing or able to accept and hold
funds
     until they can be sent to Healthy Kids.
     3.   It is said that local match gives local control.  Local match
     does not give local control.  All Healthy Kids program decisions
are
     made by State government and/or by the Healthy Kids Corporation.
     Local counties have no represention on the Healthy Kids Board of
     Directors.
     4.   If this appropriation is vetoed, when and who will be notified

     exactly how much the county match will be?  It is already too late
to
     get commitment for match by July 1, 2001.  If there must be a
match,
     please make sure that the amount is attainable and equitable, and
that
     reasonable time given for fund-raising.

     Thank you very much for your consideration of these matters.

     Sincerely yours,

Governor Bush,
Please give consideration to all of the request you have received to veto the Transportation Bill because of the billboard provisions. I know this seems like a huge tradeoff, but the reality of the billboard provisions will cost cities and counties millions of dollars. This is not the way legislation should be approved. Burying an unrelated provision into a 'must have' piece of legislation is just not right.
 
Please let the legislature and departments know by your veto of this bill that you will not endorse such actions and will stand by the principles of fairness to the citizens of Florida.

Governor:

Jim Bailey has shared the e-mail you sent him.

We by no means are trying to protect franchises.  In fact, in Tampa, Jim has
at least five competitors that publish these notices from small weeklies to
the large dailies.  Their value is not limited in the open marketplace that
they exist in today.

The issue at hand is the protection of the public's right to know.  The
objectionable language in the bill was passed in a manner so as to avoid
public hearing and scrutiny.  If there is so much merit in its substance,
why was it done so covertly?

re: VETO of HB1157

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today to request that you veto HB1157. The language in
the bill pertaining to the waiver of public notice for fictitious name
filings significantly impacts the public's right to know.

If implementation of the other provisions is delayed until next year's early
session, the impact will be minimal. But, the impact on public notice is
virtually irrevocable.

An issue this important should not be passed as a floor amendment in the
last days of session but rather deserves the full attention of the
legislature and deserves to be subjected to the full legislative process. A
veto of this bill would have no impact on existing business and minimal
impact on a new business.

My family has been publishing newspapers in Florida since 1912 and we have
always recognized and embraced technological advances.

Like other publishers I'm not opposed to the internet as a supplement to
printed legal notice. In fact my papers post notices simultaneously on the
internet at no cost.

Bill Gates recently told the student body at Georgetown University when
discussing his book "Business At The Speed Of Thought" that "the internet
was not designed to replace newspapers". We agree.

We need to look beyond the impact on individual business or industry and
focus on a responsible partnership between those charged with keeping the
public informed. This will assure that the public's right to know is not
only maintained but enhanced.

The foundation of peoples trust in government hinges on their leaders'
commitment to keep citizens informed. The passage of this legislation
impinges the source of access to public information. Therefor I urge you to
veto HB1157.

Sincerely

Governor Jeb Bush
The Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida


Dear Governor Bush:

Transportation Bill CS HB 1053/SB 2056, now before you, contains an amendment 
that virtually eliminates billboard removal and will seriously erode the 
rights of Florida residents and the scenic beauty of the state. Citizens for 
a Scenic Florida asks that you exercise your power of veto to stop this 
deeply alarming piece of legislation from becoming law.

Citizens of hundreds of Florida cities labored, conscientiously following the 
democratic process, to rid their communities of the damage inflicted upon 
them by billboards. The billboard amendment to CS HB 1053/SB 2056, in 
defiance of thirty years of Florida court decisions, will negate the results 
of the laws those citizens established and will thereby also endanger their 
right to home rule. The express will of hundreds of thousands of citizens 
will be denied and they will be stripped of their status as legally empowered 
participants in the governing process. 

The fact of the bill's passage through the House and Senate is a travesty of 
justice and a mockery of the carefully constructed legislative process, the 
intent of which is to express the will of the people. The will of Florida's 
citizens on this matter is extremely clear and must not be sacrificed to 
cater to wealthy billboard companies. Our state must not yield to the 
arrogant manipulations of a greedy industry that employs tactics which demean 
our politicians and embarrass Florida in the eyes of the nation. 

Citizens for a Scenic Florida respectfully requests that you veto CS HB 
1053/SB 2056. Florida's people and scenic beauty must not be abused.

Sincerely,

Lane Taylor Welch

Hello Clint:

Thank-You for your time yesterday.  As you know, we first contacted Governor Bush in late March.  Due to his always busy schedule, we were told to call in June and could get an appt. Respecting his Legislative duties,  what more could Governor Jeb Bush be remembered for than putting all the 2.5 Million Students and Parents in touch with their school life? Today parents are totally in the dark.  An article in Investor's Business Daily on 5/23 stated that by the end of 2002 the State of Washington plans to let parents use the Net to be informed and involved with all aspects of their children's studies.  Because Florida has the same current infrastructure basically statewide, we could have Florida operational by December.  Think of what a Christmas present Governor Bush could give the state!  We know Gov. Bush can catch the vision right away and get the fire.  He should be the one briefed first.  It needs to be his idea.  We will take any 30 minutes he has next week as we will be in Tallahassee several days.  We owe it to have the opportunity to play or pass.  We know he will play.  Nothing will have more impact on his legacy than this initiaive. We will call first thing Friday morning to schedule.  Other Governors are taking the lead, but their implementation time is considerably longer.  Let's get Florida out in front.  THe national press will be phenomenal.

Mr. Silver:  Governor Bush asked that I respond to your e-mail regarding the MAR Jewish Community Center.  The Governor is currently in the process of reviewing the budget and all special projects.

When Governor Bush issued his budget recommendations to the legislature this year, he included a list of criteria which special projects should meet.  One of these criteria is that the project must be within the mission of the state agency in which the project is funded.  The Senior Wellness Project is funded within the Department of Elder Affairs, and the mission of the department is to serve the most frail elders.  It is my understanding that this project may not meet that criteria.  I would appreciate any comments you have in this regard.

Thank you for your e-mail.

Jeb - 

Thanks for your response on our veto request, regarding Line Item 2032, 
Expressway Authorities, Revolving Toll Trust Fund. 

The $17 million is the  entire item, of which proviso language obligates 
$1.4 million to the "Bo's Bridge" bailout. 

Perhaps your lawyers can map out a strategy to veto only the $1.4 million if 
that is what you want to do, but I don't know if that can be accomplished - 
my hunch is that the entire $17 million may have to be vetoed to get to the 
Bo's Bridge item. 

BUT...We think you should seriously consider veto of the entire $17 million 
in any event.  The reality is that Bo's Bridge is just a symptom of the 
larger problem - an implied guarantee extended to expressway authorities 
that they can build speculative toll roads with assurance the state will 
come along and bail them out if they are so speculative that tolls fail to 
cover debit service. 

The process of encouraging these expressway authorities to build roads that 
are not going to pay for themselves in the near term is bad policy from both 
a fiscal and environmental perspective. It simply encourages "roads to 
nowhere" to please land speculators, and diverts money from highway projects 
that are truly needed by existing traffic NOW! 

Your veto of it could be accompanied by a call to a "summit" to be attended 
by DOT, expressway authorities, ect. The message would be - we are doing 
things differently from now on - no more state support for non-economic 
speculative roads that simply encourage urban sprawl in the wrong places. 

The whole "revolving toll trust fund" is now managed to harvest dollars from 
high traffic segments of the turnpike system and divert those funds to 
provide seed money for speculative expressways -- likely in the wrong, 
environmentally sensitive places. You can turn that around and direct that 
scarce road funds be much more carefully directed to urgently needed roads 
in existing urban areas. 

Chief current offenders (likely tomorrow's "Bo's Bridges") are: 

*  Suncoast Parkway Project extension in Citrus County 

*  St.Lucie County Expressway Authority (proposed bridges across Indian 
River Aquatic Preserve, and SEVERAL "Preservation 2000" land purchases) 

*  Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority's proposed extension of 
Western Beltway up into Lake County (Sprawl promoting in rural lands) 

*  Santa Rosa Bay Bridge Authority new bridge from Pensacola to Pensacola 
Beach (would run right beside a non-toll bridge to same destination - sure 
to fail economically). 

Right now the local expressway authorities can propose these things with 
abandon - they have no risk. The state practice is to bail them out. 

Hope you will veto and say "NO MORE"! 


Charles

Dear Governor Bush

Thank you for your timely response.

As demonstrated by the variety of letters from daily and weekly newspapers
around the state, it is very much a free and open marketplace. It is not our
intention to protect franchises or limit where these ads can be printed, but
protect the peoples' right to know.

This type of legislation will act to limit the value that newspapers serve.

We feel that the means by which the objectionable language in this
legislation got passed was not not in the publics best interest. It is
ironic that an issue involving notice to the public was done in a fashion to
preclude notice of its existence.

As you are aware, businesses come before the legislature in droves looking
for protection. We see the issue as guaranteeing the publics access to our
governments actions. There is no other medium which does so as effectively
and efficiently as local newspapers.

Once notice is published in cyberspace, how will interested parties prove
they were properly notified of an impending action? Imagine battles between
community groups and commissions if notice is lost.

For this and other reasons it is critical that this legislation be vetoed.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Please do the right thing NOW and sign the bill that will allow the John 
and Mable Ringling Museum to flourish and survive as one of the world’s 
greatest art, culture and educational centers which is located in your 
jurisdiction. 

This is Florida’s Museum...this is your Museum. We 
Floridians, all of us, must take care of it and we cannot do it without

Governor: The project meets criteria.  DCF has a hotline for reporting any abuse of an elder person.  They must investigate within a specified time period.  This is very similar to what is done for children.  The problem is there is little funding for protective services.  We are only providing 7% of the need for these services.  Current year funding for adult protective investigations is $12 M.  DCF asked for an additional $4.2 M this year but we did pick it up in the Governor's budget.  For adult protective services in the current year there is also $12 M and they did not ask for any additional funds for next year.  For the current year, the department estimates they will do 42,000 protective investigations, which is all they receive.  Every report of abuse is investigated.

I will send a reply to Ms. Fitzgerald indicating you are reviewing all projects but that DCF indicates the projects meets their review criteria.

Dear Governor Bush, 
As a citizen of Florida, I am dismayed to learn that our state has mandate 
Adult Protection Team to protect our vulnerable elders while at the same 
time failing to fund it in any district in the state. 
I urge you to support #337, a $100,000 pilot project for Miami Dade County

Subject:	KidCare local match

Dear Governor Bush,
Hello there!   I wanted to borrow a few minutes of your time to share my
support for line item 227 in 2001-2202 Appropriations Bill that eliminates,
for one year, the local match requirement for eligible children in the
Florida KidCare Program.  As you may know, I was the volunteer chair for the
Tallahasssee Leadership Roundtable over the past year and a half bringing
together diverse leadership interests for the benefit of united community
needs.  Health Care and the barrier of the local match became one of our
four priorities for improvement this past year.  As you know, Florida is the
only state in the country that has a requirement for the local match. More
than half of the counties in the state could not fully participate in the
program because they did not meet their required local 
match.  The local match requirement has been and will continue to be a major
barrier to fully 
enrolling Leon County's low-income, uninsured children in KidCare. The money
identified in the bill to offset the local match is already there, it will
come from a $27 million reserve fund that currently exists in the 
Healthy Kids program.  Thank you for your consideration of support for this
important initiative.   

Thanks too for all that Liza McFadden and Don Pemberton are doing to further
develop your mentoring initiative.  I have really enjoyed getting to know
and to work with both of them.  They and the program are fantastic!!!  I
hope to see you soon.  


Most Sincerely,
Susie Busch Transou

You have asked each of us to give you a yes or no call on bills and budget

On HB 1053, my recommendation is that you sign the bill.  While it is quite
long, to my knowledge their is only one section (#6) that was not included in
the bill during the Committee review process.  All other sections were either
in the original committee drafts, were amendments that were added in committee,
or were other bills added that had been heard in committee (e.g. road
designations).

The bill contains nearly everything the Department asked for, including
additional right-of-way and bridge bonding capacity, our re-org package
(including the Turnpike Enterprise), delegation authority to local government
to streamline permitting, employee bidding and many technical modifications.

re: VETO of HB1157

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today to request that you veto HB1157. The language in
the bill pertaining to the waiver of public notice for fictitious name
filings significantly impacts the public's right to know.

If implementation of the other provisions is delayed until next year's early
session, the impact will be minimal. But, the impact on public notice is
virtually irrevocable.

An issue this important should not be passed as a floor amendment in the
last days of session but rather deserves the full attention of the
legislature and deserves to be subjected to the full legislative process. A
veto of this bill would have no impact on existing business and minimal
impact on a new business.

My family has been publishing newspapers in Florida since 1912 and we have
always recognized and embraced technological advances.

Like other publishers I'm not opposed to the internet as a supplement to
printed legal notice. In fact my papers post notices simultaneously on the
internet at no cost.

Bill Gates recently told the student body at Georgetown University when
discussing his book "Business At The Speed Of Thought" that "the internet
was not designed to replace newspapers". We agree.

We need to look beyond the impact on individual business or industry and
focus on a responsible partnership between those charged with keeping the
public informed. This will assure that the public's right to know is not
only maintained but enhanced.

The foundation of peoples trust in government hinges on their leaders'
commitment to keep citizens informed. The passage of this legislation
impinges the source of access to public information. Therefor I urge you to
veto HB1157.

Dear Governor,

I write on two matters. One is to endorse Brian Dassler for a position on
the Council for Education Policy Research and Improvement. Brian was named
Florida College Student of the Year for this past year and was also a
student of mine. He is an absolutely wonderful young man, who will become a
public school teacher. Brian has worked with minority students on this
campus and volunteered to assist low income students in our public schools.
He is one of the most genuine, decent people with whom I have had the
fortune to interact. Brian was also a top student and one of the best I have
had in class in over 30 years of teaching. I hope that you will give him
serious consideration for this Council.

The second issue is to let you know that I will shortly name Jon Mills as
Dean of the College of Law at UF. I suspect that this will not endear me to
your office, but Jon has done a terrific job as interim dean in addressing
diversity issues in the College and in bringing conflicting faculty groups
together. He also has them focused on building a stronger academic program
for our students. He will serve only two years in this position before we
conduct a national search for a dean of the college.

Best regards to you,
David

Mary Bennett applied to be appointed to the Board of Trustees for either UCF or FAMU.  Her position on PEPC was phased out.  
 
She really wants to serve on UCF.  She has no children and her career is her whole life.  With a doctorate in education and 8 years of board service on the Community College level, I think she's qualified to serve on any University board. 
 
While I don't want to malign men, I've noticed that their board attendance is not always dependable.  Her board attendance between PEPC and DBCC was over 90%.  She's only missed meeting for emergency situations.  
 
And, she will carry your message.

Importance: High


Dear Governor Bush:

As my husband often says-choose your battles wisely.  Make sure they are 
worth putting out 110% of effort.   This one is worth it, so I write to 
you-or whoever reads this-to make my point.

I believe you would agree that the concept of health insurance for children 
is critically important to their success in school and life.

I believe you fully understand the importance of Healthy Kids-basically 
underwriting the majority of health insurance policy costs for low-income 
parents.

I believe you may not understand how devastating it has been to counties 
that struggle to pay the match requirements to keep their Healthy Kids 
enrollment open.  Escambia County is one of those.  Our Healthy Kids 
enrollment was closed for over half the year in 2000.  Over 500 children 
were on the waiting list when it finally opened.  As best we can determine, 
probably 400-500 children fell off the enrollment due to what Healthy Kids 
Corporation calls "active attrition"-i.e., no grace period for payment of 
the $15 insurance premium-because our enrollment was frozen when we 
couldn't come up with the match dollars at $15,192.00 a month.  Our 
volunteers were fundraising all year.   If July brings another match 
requirement, we'll be closed again, because even major funders like the 
County and the School District do not expend funds until October.  You may 
have a few counties with Children's Taxing Districts that can fund this 
without effort, but they are the exception, not the rule.

Word is out that you may veto the elimination of the match for Healthy Kids 
this year.  As that word has spread, everyone asks me:  "What reason could 
Governor Bush possibly have for such a veto?"  Please tell me how to answer 
them.

re: VETO of HB1157

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today to request that you veto HB1157. The language in
the bill pertaining to the waiver of public notice for fictitious name
filings significantly impacts the public's right to know.

If implementation of the other provisions is delayed until next year's early
session, the impact will be minimal. But, the impact on public notice is
virtually irrevocable.

An issue this important should not be passed as a floor amendment in the
last days of session but rather deserves the full attention of the
legislature and deserves to be subjected to the full legislative process. A
veto of this bill would have no impact on existing business and minimal
impact on a new business.

My family has been publishing newspapers in Florida since 1912 and we have
always recognized and embraced technological advances.

Like other publishers I'm not opposed to the internet as a supplement to
printed legal notice. In fact my papers post notices simultaneously on the
internet at no cost.
 
Bill Gates recently told the student body at Georgetown University when
discussing his book "Business At The Speed Of Thought" that "the internet
was not designed to replace newspapers". We agree.

We need to look beyond the impact on individual business or industry and
focus on a responsible partnership between those charged with keeping the
public informed. This will assure that the public's right to know is not
only maintained but enhanced.

The foundation of peoples trust in government hinges on their leaders'
commitment to keep citizens informed. The passage of this legislation
impinges the source of access to public information. Therefor I urge you to
veto HB1157.

Jeb,  I guess that you're not resting yet due to all the mail I bet you're
getting on key (or probably everybody's personal) issues.  I haven't been
resting either, tho I am getting a bit frustrated with the inertia of the
state system.  We've got an inspiring leader but the day to day operations
are like wading thru jelled jello (not that I've actually done that).

First, I hope you keep Medipass at $3/visit.  Health Dept's provide an
impressive array of services to a very needy population that would result in
greater expense if not served. On the other hand, we can probably ( I
originally said certainly but the state requirements throw impediments in
our path like requiring us to fill out the same information on 3 different
forms) be more productive.  We do need better management reporting
mechanisms (other than HCMS).  It's one thing to say do better but it's
another to show it.

2) billboards--I know Republicans (and I am one--and have been one forever)
often retreat to "private property rights" when faced with Growth Mgmt or
other property issues (and I am really sorry we couldn't pass an
accountability bill, i.e., cost accountability for growth or add schools
into the equation) but I believe that when an area passes a billboard policy
(like St John's County) that the Legislature should not override it as they
did with the Billboard legislation slated for your pen.

3)negative formulary--I've spoken to a number of my friends on this issue
(like docs and John Thrasher)and despite some of their obvious lobbying
interests, agree that we should not force pharmacists to change the
prescriptions of docs to the generic. Perhaps this bill could pass next year
with a few caveats like, notification to physicians so they are aware and
can write the Rx accordingly; notices that pharmacies have to post telling
clients about required generic substitutions; and some requirement that
pharmacies can't go with the generic of the month (I'm also a nurse with an
80 yr old mom who is completely confused each month with the different
generics she ends up with--I was even confused when I picked up her last
meds).

Sorry for such a long message.  Hope all is well.

Issue of the day (for me)--Growth Mgmt (tho Planning for Growth is better
terminology).  I've been involved on the grassroots level thru my
neighborhood & CPAC (citizens planning advisory council) for 5-6 yrs.  For
the last 5 months, I've been participating in a Jacksonville Community
Council Inc study on "Growth Mgmt" with weekly mtgs & resource speakers.

Throughout it all, whether our state or local planning system has any teeth
or not, I have a philosophical question--does a property owner who wants to
change the feel/makeup/ambience/neighborhood identity by rezoning his
property say, to higher density residential, business park, commercial...
have the right to do so... or... do the people who live in that community
have the right to maintain the feel.//.neighborhood identity?  I've heard
several people report on your Growth Mgmt task force and what I hear is that
we need to maintain a balance--which is rather a vague charge.

I am very heartened by your desire to quantify the impact of development
thru cost accounting and think this would reduce the mystique around the
process.  Information is a valuable tool, not the whole answer, but a tool.

One other point and I'll let you go--is that in your GM Task Force and many
local endeavors, the results stress the need for local input.  I
respectively tell you that I have not seen a good local process.  Here,
people point to the CPAC as the people's input opportunity but the tired,
overworked volunteers have neither the time or the training to be effective.
The process is complicated and too long (and costly)--for both developers
and non-developers.  It needs streamlining, simplifying and the addition of
an ombudsman at the local level.  I know many of these issues are local but
I hope the State sets up sufficient guidelines to safeguard the general
public if political will is not in their favor.

I sat next to Al Cardenas at the Ponte Vedra Rep Dinner and felt guilty for
not addressing this yet, so here goes:  Altho many insurance programs don't
cover preventive care, the cost : benefit ratios to the individual for
prevention have been conclusively proven.  Prevention programs in particular
(and health programs in general) should be a priority at a time when Florida
ranks in the lowest quartile in the country for virtually all health
indicators.

Family planning services are being reduced by approx 1.2 million dollars.
This will result in increased uncompensated costs for deliveries, the care
for unwanted children, increased infant mortality, etc.

Family Health Services were reduced by $5million.  This includes school
health services (I did some school health nursing through Georgetown U. in
Washington, DC), chronic disease screening and education services, KidCare
outreach, dental...

---Using Duval county, we currently have a nurse to pupil ratio of 1:5000.
Many of the antecedents for school failure result from poor health status
and this is a natural place for early intervention.

---Chronic diseases, if left unidentified and untreated, result in increased
morbidity & costs (compared to early treatment).

---Dental care remains unavailable to the majority of FL citizens.  More
than half of children receiving Medicaid do not have access to dental care.
& the majority of uninsured adults don't either.  This can lead to
nutritional and gastrointestinal problems and an overall decrease in quality
of life.

I've been part of the health care community for years and know many
excellent, hard working, altruistic doctors, administrators and support
people working in the trenches to provide better healthcare to needy people.
We have the best medical care in the world but need to move from a largely
medical model to a preventive and empowering model.  Look at the great
strides we made in smoking cessation in the last 25 years.  Think of the
last time you went to Europe and had to wade thru all the smokers.  Come to
Jax and I'll show you around our Health Centers.

I'm off to Tallahassee tomorrow for Sen Horne's Fl Educ Funding Formula Task
Force. Take care. Holly

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a volunteer with the Junior Service League of St. Augustine and a Branch Manager with Morgan Stanley.   I have been personally involved in the planning and implementation of this county's first supervised visitation center called "Kids Bridge".  
 
The idea for Kids Bridge was the brain child of two of our local judges, Robert Mathis and John Alexander.  They came to the JSL and requested we tackle this project as we have recently turned the St.  Augustine Lighthouse and Museum over to the community.  The JSL has wholeheartedly embraced the challenge of opening the center and has spent the past 4 years realizing this dream.
 
Our community has also climbed on board.  We have the complete support of the judicial system, victim advocate's office, guardian ad litem, Children and Family Services, battered woman's shelter, Rotary Club, local law enforcement, St. Johns County Bar Association, Communities In Schools, BellSouth, Prosperity Bank, Morgan Stanley, Florida East Coast Railroad.... the list is endless.
 
We have purchased a house, are in the process of renovating it and, when complete, will have over $300k invested in just the property.  The JSL is committed to paying off the mortgage and providing continued financial support through fund raising and grant requests.  The Rotary Club of St. Augustine is also committed to continued support through its annual fundraiser.  
 
The courts estimate that we can immediately serve the needs of over 200 children through supervised visitation and custody swapping services.  Our local legislators have seen the commitment made to Kids Bridge and have included a special appropriation of $100k.   It appears that the success of this project is now in your hands.  As you review this year's budget and face the many demands on Florida's fiscal resources, I ask you to please consider the 200 children and hundreds of local citizens who are holding their breath.  We want to open before Christmas.  We need this money to do it.
 
Thanks.

 I appreciate your helping all understand that funding for the Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)  is not some university boondoggle -- as are many such requests. Nor is it blue-sky and unproven. IHMC is the largest and best known  IT-related lab in the state, as well as in the nation. In this role it has a major impact on the P'cola economy. An interesting point is that IHMC has roughly 19 million in current Federal funding ... and employs over 80 people ... all with about 500 k of state funds. Lean and mean <grrr>. Anyway thanks. 

Cheers, 

Ken

Governor 

I wanted to serve on the SBE to bring about constructive change. This is also 
why I seek to serve on the FSU board. As you know my son Casey, who has the 
good fortune to work for you during breaks, attends UVa. They have so many 
recognized programs that FSU should emulate to bring it to the higher levels 
of national prominence. 

Further, there are so many linkages that can be made into the CC and K-12 
systems, like Web-MC, that should be explored by FSU. With a good, engaged 
board it will reach new levels of prestige. I would like to be part of that 
effort. If I cannot serve all the citizens of Florida on the SBE then I would 
like to improve one little corner of the state. I know I am qualified and 
could do the job required at any board. 

The Council for Ed. Policy Research has a great charge if it is truly going 
to be able to do what is listed. I would be concerned that it not get buried, 
(as PEPC often did), 
and be able to truly accomplish what is listed. How will it relate to the 
SBE? Who will chair it? Who will staff it? Who would serve? How will the 
agenda for research and various initiatives be set? Will the Chair interact 
frequently with the SBE? Have a seat at the table so to speak? Will it be 
allowed to be cutting edge, creative and expansive? 

I know you are busy and I have rambled a bit. You know my preference and I 
leave it to you to decide how best to proceed. Who might I best talk to, to 
discuss these questions?

Subject:	drink tax

Dear Governor,

It has come to my attention that the ostensible reason for “rounding
down” the drink tax rates _ that license holders found it too confusing
to work with fractional pennies _ is complete fiction.

According to the department, 88 percent of filers pay the tax by the
gallon (not by the drink) on alcohol purchased for sale on premises
(i.e. as the bottles come off the distributors’ trucks). The remaining
12 percent of filers pay the tax on the actual number drinks that are
sold _ but these filers also pay by the gallon (by multiplying the
number of drinks sold by the number of ounces per drink, dividing by 128
ounces per gallon, and then multiplying the appropriate per-gallon tax
rate). In other words, NO FILERS calculate tax using the fractional
penny, per-drink method.

Yet as late as today, I was given this rationale directly by the
department secretary, and indirectly, by you and your staff.

Is it your policy to condone purposeful misrepresentations to further an
administration objective?

Thank you,

sd

Hello, Governor, 
Bob Ward in the Speaker's office just told me that they would very much 
like to talk to Donna Arduin about the year-round proposal . I don't know 
if you have had a chance to speak with her but if not, might you be able to 
... so that the Speaker's office can discuss the funding possibilities with 
her. 
They seem most interested in Option A -- $1,693,600 -- which would cover 
all year-round expanded coverage, any extended regular or special session, 
all reapportionment public hearings and would allow us to upgrade the 
cameras in the Cabinet room and install them in your large Conference room. 
Thank you for your time,

Subject:	Court Watch Program

Dear Governor, John S. and John G.,

Today, I went to the 11th Judiciary, it was a real joke from hell.  There is 
something very wrong with the Probate/Guardianship Hearings when the judges 
REFUSE to let anyone come in to court watch.  The rights of people must be 
very badly violated.

I went only to find that the Hearings do not start until 9:30 AM -- most of 
the Judges were late and the demeanor of not only the Judicial Assistants and 
the Bailiffs were from a horror story.  I was able to go see Chief Judge 
Farina, who was very "attentive", only because I was able to see him as I 
walked in while the Bailiff was being extremely rude.  

Chief Judge Farina, proceeded to call Adm. Judge Maria Korvick (whose office 
was EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNCOOPERATIVE) telling her that as soon as the judge 
arrived to please make sure that I would see her first about the court watch 
and not being allowed to proceed.

Judge Korvick was EXTREMELY RUDE, she came in supper late (10:00 AM) and 
screams at me from the hall area that I did not have an appointment and that 
I had no right being there.  WELL--

I followed her in to her Chamber only to be blasted even more -- to which she 
then stated that there was no Court Watch Program recognized in the court and 
that the Confidentiality laws applied to ALL her courts and therefore, I was 
not allowed in.  I know for a fact that is not totally true.  I then 
proceeded to ask her the Statute she then proceeded to say in the "books."

She proceeded to state that she was not doing the Court Watch Program Bill 
for me and that the court was not interested in a court watch program.  I 
told her the need even more than ever with her attitude and left and that I 
had NOT asked her to do the court watch and that she knew that.

I will mention at this time that the Bill is now with the Governor's 
Legislative People -- 

I will also add that Chief Judge Farina knew that I was going to Court Watch 
this week and admitted he knew and that he E-mailed Judge Korvick and asked 
her for her assistance (as Chief Judge Farina claims).  

I took off a day from work to do this -- I took a person with me to do this 
with me and only to find that I had wasted my time is not a good thing -- I 
was very upset and frustrated.

The court watch is needed and I do believe that unless problems with the 
courts and what they are doing to the "Public" is addressed we will NEVER be 
able to really resolve most of what is occurring in the courts with the 
Elderly or anyone for that matter.

Judge Korvick sent me to another court EXCEPT hers.  This is truly telling me 
they have something to hide and in violations to no end.

While I was waiting outside waiting room, a woman (what I assume to be an 
attorney) was complaining because the party that showed was another attorney 
she had not previously been informed and another person who showed that she 
was surprised that was there.

I heard another man also saying and complaining that he was not allowed to go 
into the hearings and he had a right.

All I can say is that I see a lot of wrongs here that I am already 
questioning.

Best regards to all,

Sofia

Importance:	High

As many of you now know, the Majority Office has an immediate position available for a Legislative Analyst in Tallahassee.  It is obviously a full-time job and requires someone with a strong level of experience in the Legislature, politics or both.  This analyst position will focus primarily on education issues, tax and budget matters in the office so any prior experience in those issues in Florida would be preferred.  

As you can imagine, any candidate for the job should have strong writing and communications skills.  They must be able to work well with legislators and their staff.  Legislative analysts are required track and examine legislation and draft amendments for members. They develop briefing papers for members and staff on major issues before the Legislature.  Legislative analysts are asked to develop op-ed pieces, letters, speeches, press releases and other similar communication materials for members and other constituents, so prior experience in putting together such items would be a major plus. In addition, research skills would be very useful.

We need to fill this position as soon as possible.  Any interested person should either mail, fax or e-mail a cover letter, resume and writing sample (if possible) to the House Majority Office.  All applications or inquiries will be held in strict confidence.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Thank you for your interest.

Augustine  and we have been

money to run the actual program.

I am a huge supporter of the Bush family.  I am a republican and do realize

On another subject, we hope you will look long and hard at SB 770 before
doing anything adverse on it.  This is a benefit which officers used to
have.  PBA, joined this year by the Sheriff's Association, FDLE and
others, has been working four years to restore it.  This is pretty much
a motherhood and apple pie issue, at least from our perspective.  In
fact, after legislators heard the whole story, in committee after
committee and on the floor itself, the issue passed by unanimous or
nearly unanimous vote.  Three or four years ago, for instance, it passed
out the House by unanimous vote after it was placed on consent
calendar.  This is a pretty big issue for our officers, and we ask that
you give it the due consideration to which it is entitled.  Thank you
for any consideration given this request.  Sincerely, David Murrell,

Congratulations on you and your brother being in Tampa.  I heard about it too late or I surely would have been there.  Whatever we can do to help you stay in the Governor's Office, we're going to do. 
 
I do have a favor I need though.  I hate to ask at this time, but I'm a member of the Florida Sports Hall of Fame (along with Wayne Huizenga and many others) and we've been trying to obtain funding from the State.  The Legislature has approved an appropriation of $250,000 for the Hall of Fame in their final budget and I'm writing to ask that you approve this appropriation.  You vetoed a similar appropriation a couple of years ago, but we really need to do this, if at all possible.  I know all the pressure there is on you, but if there's a way to give us a hand on this, I'd surely appreciate it. 
 
Hope all is well, and if there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to call.

"'Our children's welfare never seemed to be a consideration,' Parent Kimberly 
Odziemski said.  Parents said Principal Janice Payne did not tell them why 
teacher Heidi Clarizio left in February, and that Payne later denied even 
knowing about the allegations."
COMMENT: Lies, coverup, and deny, deny, deny has been a standard of the 
Hillsborough County School District which has worked well for them in the 
past.  
Bob Doran
=============================================================
Jun 6, 2001 
Parents want principal removed over handling of possible abuses 
MARILYN BROWN of The Tampa Tribune

Angry and tearful, six parents and one grandparent Tuesday night demanded the 
removal of a principal under investigation for how she handled allegations a 
teacher locked children in a dark bathroom. 

Parent Kimberly Odziemski cried as she handed the Hillsborough County School 
Board a petition she said carried 1,508 signatures to remove Kingswood 
Elementary Principal Janice Payne. She later said the signatures were 
gathered ``from the community,'' not just parents at the Brandon school. 

Parents said Payne did not tell them why teacher Heidi Clarizio left in 
February, and that Payne later denied even knowing about the allegations. 
Clarizio resigned after aides reported she locked her 3- to 5-year-old 
developmentally delayed students in a dark restroom as punishment and threw a 
chair across the room. 

``Our children's welfare never seemed to be a consideration,'' Odziemski 
said. Parents are most concerned because they didn't learn about the 
allegations until 2 1/2 weeks ago, parent Dennis Clift said. 

``We think it started in August and went to February,'' said parent Hart 
Mantzel. ``I don't believe she [Clarizio] was ever supervised.'' 

Several parents said their children have wet their beds or had nightmares as 
a result of the incidents at school. If they had known the cause, parents 
said, they could have gotten counseling for their children earlier. 

Payne could not be reached late Tuesday. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's 
Office is continuing its investigation, and the school district will complete 
its inquiry into ``the incident itself and how the entire matter was 
handled'' within two weeks, said Assistant Superintendent David Binnie. 

Calling the situation ``one of the most horrific things that could happen,'' 
school board member Carol Kurdell pledged the superintendent and board will 
do ``whatever we can to help.''

It has come to my attention that the length of the appointment for the School Board vacancy here in Miami will be through 2004, not for a short period of time until a special election can be held.  For that reason, I have decided not to pursue being considered to fill the vacancy.

But I do strongly support someone not tied to the administration, former legislator or a novice in dealing with the system, I know it's a tall order, but the present chaotic situation demands it.

Knowing that you'd be making the decision makes me feel more at ease, as I know you will give it careful consideration not seek to appoint a republican or democrat, a liberal or conservative, but a person who cares for the children, who is willing to make tough decisions and who understands the need for accountability and ethics in government, and who is not beholding to anything or anyone.

Subject:	FW: COASTAL CONTROL LINE

 
Governor:
You will recall Pinellas Co. is the only county remaining not to have
established a coastal control line.
We expect to have this completed by the end of this year and have been
working with a consortium of the County's coastal communities (known as the
BigC group).  The coastal communities are exercising their option to develop
their own more flexible, lower cost alternative as allowed by law.  
 
We are working with the communities on this.  Currently their proposed
building elevation requirements do not make sense to us.  They are
substantially lower than the state standards in some areas, and substantially
higher in other areas.  While this averages out to being "close," it in fact
is not a rational way to consider whether or not adequate protection would be
provided.
 
The effort thus far has been collaborative and collegial.  There is a sense
that perhaps St. Petersburg Beach is not completely in step with the other
communities in the consortium.  This may be part of Mr. Knotek's issue.  We
are following up with him directly.
 
To complicate things a bit more, the federal government (FEMA) is
coincidentally now updating their flood maps in this area and has tentatively
proposed building construction elevations that on average are higher than
those proposed by the state.
 
I think we are managing this reasonably well, but appreciated learning that
we may have some additional work to do with Mr. Knotek's community.

Dear Mr. Bush;
 
I am the building official for the City of St. Pete Beach and I have written
to you several times with my concern about the relocation of the Coastal
Control Line in Pinellas County. You or your staff had forward my concerns to
DEP. They answered or explained their position in a general and bureaucratic
manner.
 
The concerns that I have require a common sense approach and not necessarily
a bureaucratic approach; something that the Governor's office may be able to
apply to the problem. The staff at DEP are doing their jobs in enforcing the
department's requirements and the mandates of the Statutes, however, many
times the individual model of a county is different than other parts of the
state. I would like to discuss this matter with you and your staff because it
is of an economical importance to Pinellas County. If you were to visit St.
Pete Beach, I could introduce you to the fine job that our residents are
trying to accomplish in meeting FEMA's specifications. The movement of the
coastal control line will only make their efforts non-conforming and provide
a burden to the people of Pinellas County; a burden that may not be
necessary. There is already the Federal Government with their requirements; I
see no need for the state to add even more restrictive requirements. In my
opinion the coastal sections of the statutes were intended for preserving
Florida's beautiful beaches and not to impose further building and economical
requirements to a built-out county.
 
Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 727-363-9235 or
e-mail me at building@stpetebeach.org <mailto:building@stpetebeach.org> .
Thank-you for your time and consideration.

Jeb:

First,  I hope everything is well with the family and you and I'm sorry I
miss
you on the times you visit S. Fl., maybe in Tallahassee?

Having been on the advisory board of the FHP since Mellon's days (thanks to
you),  I have some insight in the way the system is run.  I think the next
director for the FHP is an important decision given the uncertainty of its
direction and poor personnel morale.  In essence our communities have
changed
significantly over the past two decades, but the Patrol seems to conduct
business in the same old way- - it needs new thinking and someone who has
the
respect of its troopers.  Personally, I believe the Patrol needs some
restructuring to maximize exposure, become more effective and curtail costs,
but
as an advisor to the director I reserve comment  to avoid interference.

The troopers have mentioned a candidate of choice whom I am told might not
be
Fred Dickenson's first pick given that he wants to move away from the status
quo.  Since change appears to be essential and it can only be brought on by
its
leader, status quo would no longer be an option- - I am sure you agree.

My suggestion is that the selection committee be made up of an odd number of
members, and include outside advisors to avoid influencing.  Once you
appoint a
director, an advisory panel be selected to work with the patrol in coming up
with structure and cost changes to improve the department.

Please keep this in confidence since it might be construed as interference.
Any
thoughts?

Florida is the only state in the nation with such a requirement and it is a Major barrier to fully enrolling our low-income, uninsured children in KidCare.

Dear Governor Bush,
I urge you to support the local match waiver for KidCare, line item 227, in the 2001-2002 Appropriations Bill.  Florida is the only state in the nation with such a requirement and it is a Major barrier to fully enrolling our low-income, uninsured children in KidCare.  The money to offset the local match is already in the $27 million dollar reserve in Healthy Kids.
However, this waiver is for only one year.  I urge you to support the permanent elimination of this local match requirement.  
Sincerely,
Bridget Fitzgerald, MSW

Dear Governor Bush,
As a citizen of Florida, I am dismayed to learn that our state has mandate Adult Protection Team to protect our vulnerable elders while at the same time failing to fund it in any district in the state.
I urge you to support #337, a $100,000 pilot project for Miami Dade County Adult Protection Team, and other such vital programs in our state.

Governor:  Kids Bridge does not meet criteria because it is a family visitation center and we do not fund these programs.  We believe  family visitation centers are more appropriately funded from local sources.  Thus it is outside the agency's mission.  There are several family visitation centers in the budget and all fail for this reason.

Dear Gov. Bush, 

Judges, attorneys, social workers, police & families have asked, begged & 
pleaded for a family visitation ctr for St Johns County.  PLEASE APPROVE our 
$100,000 appropriation for Kids Bridge! 

30 women, members of the St Augustine Jr. Service League, have volunteered to 
get this facility up & running so the hundreds of kids needing this service 
won't have to drive an hour to Jacksonville (if they can get a ride) for 
court ordered visitation.  As a Board member of this organization for the 
past 4 years, I am proud of how much so few women can do.  We are raising 
several hundreds of thousands of $$$$ for renovation.  This money will get 
the program going. 

Thank you for your time.  If your staff has any questions, please contact the 
Honorable Judge Mathis, Judge Alexander, State Rep. Doug Wiles, or the St. 
Augustine Jr. Service League. 

Sincerely, 
Elizabeth Schrum 
Junior Service League of St. Augustine

Dear Governor Bush: 

I am writing in support of a few appropriations that are on your desk. 
Please don't veto the funding for these programs, they help our most 
vulnerable citizens - our children and our elders. 

One is the KidCare local match waiver - this would eliminate for one year, 
the local match requirement for eligible children in the Florida KidCare 
(health coverage) program (line item 227). Florida is the only state in the 
country that has this requirement.  More than half of the counties in the 
state could not fully participate in the program because they did not meet 
their required local match.  The local match requirement has been and will 
continue to be a MAJOR barrier to fully enrolling our community's 
low-income, uninsured children in KidCare.  The money identified in the bill 
to offset the local match is already there - it will come from a $27 million 
dollar reserve fund that currently exists in Healthy Kids. PLEASE do not 
veto this line item. 

HELP OUR VULNERABLE ELDERS - please do NOT to VETO #337, a $100,000 pilot 
project for Miami Dade County Adult Protection Team.  This state mandated 
program has never been funded for any district in the state.  Miami Dade 
desperately needs this enhanced service to protect its vulnerable elders. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Melissa Spirt Buckner, Esq.

Jeb, 

It has come to my attention that the length of the appointment for the School Board vacancy here in Miami will be through 2004, not for a short period of time until a special election can be held.  For that reason, I have decided not to pursue being considered to fill the vacancy.  Now that we are talking about that almost an entire term, you'd need to look at an individual from that community who would have a better understanding of their constituents needs. But I do strongly support someone not tied to the administration, former legislator or a novice in dealing with the system, I know it's a tall order, but the present chaotic situation demands it.  

At a time where our fellow citizens distrust the system; where children are not receiving the kind of education that we are paying for AND THAT THEY DESERVE,  makes this selection of utmost importance.  Knowing that you'd be making the decision makes me feel more at ease, as I know you will give it careful consideration not seek to appoint a republican or democrat, a liberal or conservative, but a person who cares for the children, who is willing to make tough decisions and who understands the need for accountability and ethics in government, and who is not beholding to anything or anyone.

I think your leadership on this major change will end up as one of the most important and successful long-term changes for Florida's students, and for our state's economic viability. Thanks for your leadership.
 
I also want to put in a last minute pitch for Randy Hanna as a board member for FAMU, or perhaps FSU or Florida. Randy has a proven track record in his commitment and service in K-12, as a board member at TCC and the State Board of Community Colleges, and he is a graduate of both FSU and Florida.
 
In thinking about which board he would be best on, my thought would be for him to serve at FAMU, over FSU and UF, because he has a strong, sincere desire to see FAMU succeed and become a stronger partner in this community. He also understands some of the challenges we have had with FAMU not wanting to work with our community colleges, and he would be a good board member to encourage the university to work with our colleges and to reach out to schools and communities in this area and across the state. Also Randy, more than any other board member I've worked with, commits whatever time is needed to be deeply involved with his responsibilities, even going beyond the call of duty sometimes to be engaged with employees and students. He's been involved also on several statewide groups and is well known with a variety of constituency groups across the state, as well as in this community. Finally, he is committed to your vision of a seamless K-20 system, focused on students. 
 
Thanks for considering him.
 
J. David Armstrong, Jr.
Executive Director
Florida Community College System

Subject: Appropriations bill


Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing in support of a few appropriations that are on your desk.
Please don't veto the funding for these programs, they help our most
vulnerable citizens - our children and our elders.

One is the KidCare local match waiver - this would eliminate for one year,
the local match requirement for eligible children in the Florida KidCare
(health coverage) program (line item 227). Florida is the only state in the
country that has this requirement.  More than half of the counties in the
state could not fully participate in the program because they did not meet
their required local match.  The local match requirement has been and will
continue to be a MAJOR barrier to fully enrolling our community's
low-income, uninsured children in KidCare.  The money identified in the bill
to offset the local match is already there - it will come from a $27 million
dollar reserve fund that currently exists in Healthy Kids. PLEASE do not
veto this line item.

HELP OUR VULNERABLE ELDERS - please do NOT to VETO #337, a $100,000 pilot
project for Miami Dade County Adult Protection Team.  This state mandated
program has never been funded for any district in the state.  Miami Dade
desperately needs this enhanced service to protect its vulnerable elders.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Melissa Spirt Buckner, Esq.

Jeb:

First,  I hope everything is well with the family and you and I'm sorry I miss
you on the times you visit S. Fl., maybe in Tallahassee?

Having been on the advisory board of the FHP since Mellon's days (thanks to
you),  I have some insight in the way the system is run.  I think the next
director for the FHP is an important decision given the uncertainty of its
direction and poor personnel morale.  In essence our communities have changed
significantly over the past two decades, but the Patrol seems to conduct
business in the same old way- - it needs new thinking and someone who has the
respect of its troopers.  Personally, I believe the Patrol needs some
restructuring to maximize exposure, become more effective and curtail costs, but
as an advisor to the director I reserve comment  to avoid interference.

The troopers have mentioned a candidate of choice whom I am told might not be
Fred Dickenson's first pick given that he wants to move away from the status
quo.  Since change appears to be essential and it can only be brought on by its
leader, status quo would no longer be an option- - I am sure you agree.

My suggestion is that the selection committee be made up of an odd number of
members, and include outside advisors to avoid influencing.  Once you appoint a
director, an advisory panel be selected to work with the patrol in coming up
with structure and cost changes to improve the department.

Please keep this in confidence since it might be construed as interference.  Any
thoughts?

Thanks.  Have you heard from Crespo on this?  He's all over it.

We're helping with a lottery shoot right now that is being shot by a Florida
production company.  Go David!

Of the industry feedback that I've received overnight, the industry wants to
know that you urge the use of Florida based production entities.  We are now
preparing info kits w/production guides to send to the agencies (EOG,
Cabinet, and others).  Would like to send this info under a cover letter
from you.

Dear Gov. Bush, 

Judges, attorneys, social workers, police & families have asked, begged & 
pleaded for a family visitation ctr for St Johns County.  PLEASE APPROVE our 
$100,000 appropriation for Kids Bridge! 

30 women, members of the St Augustine Jr. Service League, have volunteered to 
get this facility up & running so the hundreds of kids needing this service 
won't have to drive an hour to Jacksonville (if they can get a ride) for 
court ordered visitation.  As a Board member of this organization for the 
past 4 years, I am proud of how much so few women can do.  We are raising 
several hundreds of thousands of $$$$ for renovation.  This money will get 
the program going. 

Thank you for your time.  If your staff has any questions, please contact the 
Honorable Judge Mathis, Judge Alexander, State Rep. Doug Wiles, or the St. 
Augustine Jr. Service League. 

Sincerely, 
Elizabeth Schrum 
Junior Service League of St. Augustine

The three water quality related bills are crucial. The water quality of both the Chassahowitzka and the Homosassa rivers has been documented to be in serious decline.
 
Please do not veto;
$1,000,000 for the Chassahowitzka sewers.

Dear Governor:  It is our understanding that you will soon have an

Commissioner Rudy Maloy,
whom you have removed from office.  On behalf of Florida PBA and Big
Bend PBA (which represents the Tallahassee Police Department and other

DePuy to fill this vacancy.  We have known Mr. DePuy for many years and
know him to be of the highest integrity and be a very capable
individual.  An added plus for us is that he has an extensive law
enforcement background and thus knows our issues very well.
    For all of these reasons and more, Governor, we believe Mr. DePuy
will make a fine public servant and urge you to appoint him to this
position.  Any consideration
given this request would be greatly appreciated.

This waiver is necessary to remove the barrier that keeps  many low-income, uninsured children from participating in the Healthy Kids program and thereby receiving essential health care services.
Day in and day out I see the effects that a lack of health services has upon our children. Many families are doing the very best that they can but cannot make a wage high enough to pay for health care for their children and their employers do not provide health insurance at a reasonable cost. I believe that the dollars that are spent on our most vulnerable citizens, our children, is well worth whatever it costs us as a state.
Please support this very important program by supporting this Appropriations Bill when it reaches your desk. Let's not let Florida be the only state to require a local match for these funds.

Dear Governor Bush:

My  CEO of Eller Media, Karl Eller has corresponded with you on our issue
and copied me on his correspondence.   As President of the FOAA, (Florida
Outdoor Advertising Association) I wanted to make a few additional points on
the irreparable harm that a veto could have.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO OUR INDUSTRY:  There could be a loss of irreplaceable
assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with increasing litigation
costs for sign owners and cities and counties.  There would be uncertainty
about how to conduct business in Florida.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA BUSINESSES AND JOBS:  Local businesses will lose
revenue if they lose access to billboard advertising on the non-federal
roadways (this will only occur if municipalities can remove billboards for
"free" - It goes without saying that municipalities will only remove
billboards if they can confiscate them without paying.  Dr. Charles Taylor
of Villanova University completed a survey in October, 2000, of businesses
that advertise on billboards, including Florida Businesses.  Of the
businesses sampled, 75% report that will lose an average of 18% of gross
sales if they do not have access to billboard advertising.  What small
business can sustain this loss?  Respondents rated billboards substantially
higher than any other advertising medium in terms of "ability to communicate
information at a price you can afford." Seventy-nine percent of the local
businesses advertising on billboards are small businesses with less than 50
employees.  The forced removal could also have a negative impact on local
jobs.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA LANDOWNERS:  Florida landowners will lose
millions of dollars in lease fees if billboards are forced to be removed.
More than 95% of billboard locations are on 3rd party private property.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA TOURISTS AND RESIDENTS:  In a U.S. Commerce
Department Survey, 95% of travelers in America said they rely on billboards
to locate gas, food, lodging and tourist attractions.  Billboard advertising
is particularly crucial for Florida tourism oriented businesses.  It is the
ONLY medium that matches up with the inherently transitory character of the
tourist audience - newspapers can't, TV is not available in cars, etc.
There is literally no certain way for a business to communicate with
travelers, both local and tourists,  in vehicles except billboard
advertising.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA CHARITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICE RECIPIENTS:  Over
$10 million is contributed in advertising space annually to organizations
who often have no other medium available to them.

Governor,  like Karl Eller, I am passionate about this issue. Our industry
followed the process.  I fear our members, landowners, employees, customers,
suppliers, public service recipients etc. will all become disenchanted with
this process if our bill does not pass into law.  We could not begin to ask
our supporters in the legislature to deal with this issue any time in the
near future.  Our industry could be decimated in Florida as we now know it.
There will be irreparable harm. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: Southwood Charter School Project


Governor:

Sorry to email you this, but I need your feedback directly:

We've partnered with Arvida/St. Joe to develop several charter schools
across Florida in new home communities, including Southwood in Tallahassee,
next to the new FSU Lab School.  Because the Lab School will primarily
continue to hold its current population, there's a need for new student
stations for the new homes (something Arvida believes the district would
support).  Arvida is planning some attractive ways to value add and create
incentives for their residents.

I also understand that the state offices located there house some 5-6,000
employees.  The question is: would you support, in concept, the school
setting aside 50% of the seats (we expect to ultimately have 1600 seats,
k-12) for state employees' children on site.  We could do this under the
statute's charter-in-the-workplace provisions, similar to Ryder's set aside.
The remaining seats would be for the homeowners and community at large,
including others outside Southwood.  We would also like to name the school,
The Governor's Academy.

If you are at least open to this, could I set up a brief call w/you to
discuss further what this would entail, etc.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush:

My  CEO of Eller Media, Karl Eller has corresponded with you on our issue
and copied me on his correspondence.   As President of the FOAA, (Florida
Outdoor Advertising Association) I wanted to make a few additional points on
the irreparable harm that a veto could have.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO OUR INDUSTRY:  There could be a loss of irreplaceable
assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with increasing litigation
costs for sign owners and cities and counties.  There would be uncertainty
about how to conduct business in Florida.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA BUSINESSES AND JOBS:  Local businesses will lose
revenue if they lose access to billboard advertising on the non-federal
roadways (this will only occur if municipalities can remove billboards for
"free" - It goes without saying that municipalities will only remove
billboards if they can confiscate them without paying.  Dr. Charles Taylor
of Villanova University completed a survey in October, 2000, of businesses
that advertise on billboards, including Florida Businesses.  Of the
businesses sampled, 75% report that will lose an average of 18% of gross
sales if they do not have access to billboard advertising.  What small
business can sustain this loss?  Respondents rated billboards substantially
higher than any other advertising medium in terms of "ability to communicate
information at a price you can afford." Seventy-nine percent of the local
businesses advertising on billboards are small businesses with less than 50
employees.  The forced removal could also have a negative impact on local
jobs.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA LANDOWNERS:  Florida landowners will lose
millions of dollars in lease fees if billboards are forced to be removed.
More than 95% of billboard locations are on 3rd party private property.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA TOURISTS AND RESIDENTS:  In a U.S. Commerce
Department Survey, 95% of travelers in America said they rely on billboards
to locate gas, food, lodging and tourist attractions.  Billboard advertising
is particularly crucial for Florida tourism oriented businesses.  It is the
ONLY medium that matches up with the inherently transitory character of the
tourist audience - newspapers can't, TV is not available in cars, etc.
There is literally no certain way for a business to communicate with
travelers, both local and tourists,  in vehicles except billboard
advertising.

IRREPARABLE HARM TO FLORIDA CHARITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICE RECIPIENTS:  Over
$10 million is contributed in advertising space annually to organizations
who often have no other medium available to them.

Governor,  like Karl Eller, I am passionate about this issue. Our industry
followed the process.  I fear our members, landowners, employees, customers,
suppliers, public service recipients etc. will all become disenchanted with
this process if our bill does not pass into law.  We could not begin to ask
our supporters in the legislature to deal with this issue any time in the
near future.  Our industry could be decimated in Florida as we now know it.
There will be irreparable harm. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a volunteer with the Junior Service League of St. Augustine and a Branch Manager with Morgan Stanley.   I have been personally involved in the planning and implementation of this county's first supervised visitation center called "Kids Bridge".  
 
The idea for Kids Bridge was the brain child of two of our local judges, Robert Mathis and John Alexander.  They came to the JSL and requested we tackle this project as we have recently turned the St.  Augustine Lighthouse and Museum over to the community.  The JSL has wholeheartedly embraced the challenge of opening the center and has spent the past 4 years realizing this dream.
 
Our community has also climbed on board.  We have the complete support of the judicial system, victim advocate's office, guardian ad litem, Children and Family Services, battered woman's shelter, Rotary Club, local law enforcement, St. Johns County Bar Association, Communities In Schools, BellSouth, Prosperity Bank, Morgan Stanley, Florida East Coast Railroad.... the list is endless.
 
We have purchased a house, are in the process of renovating it and, when complete, will have over $300k invested in just the property.  The JSL is committed to paying off the mortgage and providing continued financial support through fund raising and grant requests.  The Rotary Club of St. Augustine is also committed to continued support through its annual fundraiser.  
 
The courts estimate that we can immediately serve the needs of over 200 children through supervised visitation and custody swapping services.  Our local legislators have seen the commitment made to Kids Bridge and have included a special appropriation of $100k.   It appears that the success of this project is now in your hands.  As you review this year's budget and face the many demands on Florida's fiscal resources, I ask you to please consider the 200 children and hundreds of local citizens who are holding their breath.  We want to open before Christmas.  We need this money to do it.
 
Thanks.

Dear Mr. Crist:
 
As a  long time educator,  I have seen with dismay the lack of response from Tallahassee to the now decade long scandals and fraud in the Dade County School systems. The system can not be fixed from within ,because it is run by corrupt leaders, including school board members. This is not just an opinion. I have been willing to share my testimony with anyone that would listen, including the present State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle. Unfortunately she is part of the problem. politicas in Miami is I scratch your back, you scratch my back.
 
Governor Bush has now the opportunity to appoint a  board member to replace Mr. Demetrio Perez, whose unethical business practices are not confined to housing.
 
I urge you to speak to the governor about the two most worthy candidates: Carlos Valdes and Lucy Margolis. Former representative Valdes took our complaints to Talla.in the early 90's; information provided to him by educators like myself thru Independent Voices for Better Education , headed then by Lucy Margolis, Charlotte Greembarg and Charles Johnson to name a few. The school board, the then superintendent Octavio Viciedo and the United Teachers of Dade declared open war against rep. Valdes and spent money and used slander and lies to unseat him. Needless to say that as an employee to even speak to a member of Independent Voices was considered conspiring.
In 1992 Independent Voices presented in the public hearing of May 5 evidence that the father of Roger Cuevas was receiving a sa;ary as a teacher at Lindsey Hopkins Tech. Center, but he taught no classes. A similar situation was that of Mr. Viciedo's sister. The evidence were pay roll information, plus computarized class roles where Mr. Cuevas' senior was not the teacher. The school board members vilified Mrs. Margolis and her group. Many heads rolled if suspected of collaborating with them. I was transferred involuntarily, with a 1 hr notice from a 12 months position to a 10 months job across town . This ,after 17 years of service at that school, having been a finalist  as district teacher of the year  in 1987 and Post-Seconday Counselor for Fla. in 1991.
 
I will be retiring at the end of this year, my health affected by the difficulty of trying to do a good job in a system plagued with corruption. I work now at a school with a great principal, an honest, bright man in a sea of incompetent bosses( my opinion, not his). However, my health is at stake.
 
The situation in Dade County schools can not be fixed by one or two honest individuals, but that is a start. Both Mrs. Margolis and Mr. Valdes have earned the right to represent us. However, because Mr. Perez represented a hispanic district,(where he really did no live) I feel Mr. Valdes would be a better voice for this district.  Lucy Margolis is a college classmate and one of the most honest individuals I knew then and now. She should be nominated by your office or the governor to help restore dignity tothis school system.
 
Please pass on this request to Governor Bush.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing in support of a few appropriations that are on your desk.
Please don't veto the funding for these programs, they help our most
vulnerable citizens - our children and our elders.

One is the KidCare local match waiver - this would eliminate for one year,
the local match requirement for eligible children in the Florida KidCare
(health coverage) program (line item 227). Florida is the only state in the
country that has this requirement.  More than half of the counties in the
state could not fully participate in the program because they did not meet
their required local match.  The local match requirement has been and will
continue to be a MAJOR barrier to fully enrolling our community's
low-income, uninsured children in KidCare.  The money identified in the bill
to offset the local match is already there - it will come from a $27 million
dollar reserve fund that currently exists in Healthy Kids. PLEASE do not
veto this line item.

HELP OUR VULNERABLE ELDERS - please do NOT to VETO #337, a $100,000 pilot
project for Miami Dade County Adult Protection Team.  This state mandated
program has never been funded for any district in the state.  Miami Dade
desperately needs this enhanced service to protect its vulnerable elders.

Thank you for your consideration.

Jeb:

First,  I hope everything is well with the family and you and I'm sorry I miss
you on the times you visit S. Fl., maybe in Tallahassee?

Having been on the advisory board of the FHP since Mellon's days (thanks to
you),  I have some insight in the way the system is run.  I think the next
director for the FHP is an important decision given the uncertainty of its
direction and poor personnel morale.  In essence our communities have changed
significantly over the past two decades, but the Patrol seems to conduct
business in the same old way- - it needs new thinking and someone who has the
respect of its troopers.  Personally, I believe the Patrol needs some
restructuring to maximize exposure, become more effective and curtail costs, but
as an advisor to the director I reserve comment  to avoid interference.

The troopers have mentioned a candidate of choice whom I am told might not be
Fred Dickenson's first pick given that he wants to move away from the status
quo.  Since change appears to be essential and it can only be brought on by its
leader, status quo would no longer be an option- - I am sure you agree.

My suggestion is that the selection committee be made up of an odd number of
members, and include outside advisors to avoid influencing.  Once you appoint a
director, an advisory panel be selected to work with the patrol in coming up
with structure and cost changes to improve the department.

Please keep this in confidence since it might be construed as interference.  Any
thoughts?

Governor, 
 
I'm excited about our new governance structure and look forward to working for you and our new Florida Board and Secretary. I think your leadership on this major change will end up as one of the most important and successful long-term changes for Florida's students, and for our state's economic viability. Thanks for your leadership.
 
I also want to put in a last minute pitch for Randy Hanna as a board member for FAMU, or perhaps FSU or Florida. Randy has a proven track record in his commitment and service in K-12, as a board member at TCC and the State Board of Community Colleges, and he is a graduate of both FSU and Florida.
 
In thinking about which board he would be best on, my thought would be for him to serve at FAMU, over FSU and UF, because he has a strong, sincere desire to see FAMU succeed and become a stronger partner in this community. He also understands some of the challenges we have had with FAMU not wanting to work with our community colleges, and he would be a good board member to encourage the university to work with our colleges and to reach out to schools and communities in this area and across the state. Also Randy, more than any other board member I've worked with, commits whatever time is needed to be deeply involved with his responsibilities, even going beyond the call of duty sometimes to be engaged with employees and students. He's been involved also on several statewide groups and is well known with a variety of constituency groups across the state, as well as in this community. Finally, he is committed to your vision of a seamless K-20 system, focused on students. 
 
Thanks for considering him.

Jeb, 

It has come to my attention that the length of the appointment for the School Board vacancy here in Miami will be through 2004, not for a short period of time until a special election can be held.  For that reason, I have decided not to pursue being considered to fill the vacancy.  Now that we are talking about that almost an entire term, you'd need to look at an individual from that community who would have a better understanding of their constituents needs. But I do strongly support someone not tied to the administration, former legislator or a novice in dealing with the system, I know it's a tall order, but the present chaotic situation demands it.  

At a time where our fellow citizens distrust the system; where children are not receiving the kind of education that we are paying for AND THAT THEY DESERVE,  makes this selection of utmost importance.  Knowing that you'd be making the decision makes me feel more at ease, as I know you will give it careful consideration not seek to appoint a republican or democrat, a liberal or conservative, but a person who cares for the children, who is willing to make tough decisions and who understands the need for accountability and ethics in government, and who is not beholding to anything or anyone.

Subject:	Kids Bridge family visitation ctr

Dear Gov. Bush, 

Judges, attorneys, social workers, police & families have asked, begged & 
pleaded for a family visitation ctr for St Johns County.  PLEASE APPROVE our 
$100,000 appropriation for Kids Bridge! 

30 women, members of the St Augustine Jr. Service League, have volunteered to 
get this facility up & running so the hundreds of kids needing this service 
won't have to drive an hour to Jacksonville (if they can get a ride) for 
court ordered visitation.  As a Board member of this organization for the 
past 4 years, I am proud of how much so few women can do.  We are raising 
several hundreds of thousands of $$$$ for renovation.  This money will get 
the program going. 

Thank you for your time.  If your staff has any questions, please contact the 
Honorable Judge Mathis, Judge Alexander, State Rep. Doug Wiles, or the St. 
Augustine Jr. Service League. 

Sincerely, 
Elizabeth Schrum 
Junior Service League of St. Augustine

Subject:	Healthy Kids local match issue

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush:

As my husband often says-choose your battles wisely.  Make sure they are 
worth putting out 110% of effort.   This one is worth it, so I write to 
you-or whoever reads this-to make my point.

I believe you would agree that the concept of health insurance for children 
is critically important to their success in school and life.

I believe you fully understand the importance of Healthy Kids-basically 
underwriting the majority of health insurance policy costs for low-income 
parents.

I believe you may not understand how devastating it has been to counties 
that struggle to pay the match requirements to keep their Healthy Kids 
enrollment open.  Escambia County is one of those.  Our Healthy Kids 
enrollment was closed for over half the year in 2000.  Over 500 children 
were on the waiting list when it finally opened.  As best we can determine, 
probably 400-500 children fell off the enrollment due to what Healthy Kids 
Corporation calls "active attrition"-i.e., no grace period for payment of 
the $15 insurance premium-because our enrollment was frozen when we 
couldn't come up with the match dollars at $15,192.00 a month.  Our 
volunteers were fundraising all year.   If July brings another match 
requirement, we'll be closed again, because even major funders like the 
County and the School District do not expend funds until October.  You may 
have a few counties with Children's Taxing Districts that can fund this 
without effort, but they are the exception, not the rule.

Word is out that you may veto the elimination of the match for Healthy Kids 
this year.  As that word has spread, everyone asks me:  "What reason could 
Governor Bush possibly have for such a veto?"  Please tell me how to answer 
them.

Subject:	RE: Florida Just Compensation

Dear Governor Bush:

I am extremely grateful for your fast response to my letter. 

You asked, what irreparable harm would our industry suffer if this
legislation does not pass.  When any citizen or business in America has
their property taken without compensation, all citizens suffer irreparable
harm.  

Our industry is being harmed every day in Florida through amortization
ordinances.  Many small owners, who cannot afford long, expensive legal
battles, simply give up and lose their property through this type of
confiscation.    

Immediately following the 2000 session, through meetings facilitated by you
and your staff, we began working the just compensation legislation through
the process.  Cities and Counties, such as Orlando enacted an amortization
ordinance during the process.  Because they assumed, correctly, that the
legislation was going to pass the House and Senate, Orlando came to the
table in the final days with a proposed settlement, which we agreed to;
which we did not like, but could live with.  

If this just compensation legislation does not pass into law this year,
cities and counties are now mobilized on our issue and will attempt similar
amortization ordinances or bans throughout the State with help from their
powerful allies, the newspapers, a major competitor for advertising dollars.
Governor, as a real estate developer, you can understand how actions by a
local government could be devastating if you did not have the protection of
state property rights laws.  Billboard owners currently do not have the same
rights and protections as every other business or developer in Florida.
Without this legislation, our inventory could be decimated.  

Although 38 other states have just compensation legislation to protect their
interests (5 states have no billboards) the outdoor industry has been trying
to pass legislation in Florida to protect our property for 16 years.
(Senator John Grant sponsored legislation three times.)  An Eller employee
is fond of quoting a legislator from Miami who said in a hearing a number of
years ago,  " Amortization?  I don't particularly like signs and billboards,
but I do like property rights.  I'm from Cuba; instead of giving you 7 years
to own your property, Castro gave you 7 seconds.  I am going to support this
property rights legislation."

Although the legislation passed by an overwhelming majority this year, 106-8
in the House and 39-1 in the Senate, because of the mobilization of the
Cities and Counties and the liberal competitive newspapers in opposition,
this is not legislation that our courageous supporters in the House and
Senate will want to address again any time in the near future.  

As previously mentioned, our company, other companies in Florida, and cities
and counties will spend millions of dollars in legal bills on this issue.
(In spite of the fact that in recent polls, residents and tourists indicate
that they like billboards, find them useful and do not want government
wasting time and money to try to ban them.)  What usually occurs is that
during the lengthly legal process, the industry and city and county come to
the table and a compromise is worked out.  The pending legislation allows
for arbitration and relocation if the billboard is in an incongruous
location rather than payment, which would insure the ongoing viability of
our legitimate business.  But, if the legislation is not enacted, our
industry will now be a target for all cities and counties. 

Governor Bush, I intended to be brief, but as you can see, I am passionate
about this business.  In Florida, according to a Washington Economic Group
study, our industry revenues are in excess of $613 million and pays $25
million in sales tax and $13 million in government permits and licenses. It
is not just my business and the welfare of our employees, but also our
competitors, the single billboard owner, the landowners who will lose
millions of dollars in lease fees,  tourists, and our local and national
advertisers who rely on our product, who will be adversely affected. Simply
said, if this legislation does not become law, this industry can be
destroyed in Florida as we now know it.  

I close with a quote from the Florida Times Union, April 17, 2001: 

"When it is deemed in the public's interest that billboards be removed,
those who benefit - the public- should compensate the company adversely
affected by the government's actions. . .The Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution says private property cannot 'be taken for public use without
just compensation.' The courts have not intervened, so it is up to the
Legislature to mandate a uniform and equitable system statewide."

Governor Bush, the Legislature passed our bill after numerous public
hearings.  The judicial system has not been fair on our issue in Florida.  I
respectfully urge you to allow this property rights legislation to become
law.

Karl Eller

Dear Governor Bush:

In a briefing from our Florida offices, I was pleased to learn that just
compensation legislation passed by an overwhelming majority in the House and
Senate and the Transportation Bill is now on its way to your desk for your
signature. As you know, the Florida outdoor advertising industry has worked
for three years on passing this important property rights legislation.

Through a friendship with your Father and as chairman for your brother's
campaign in the great state of Arizona, I have always felt that your family
was strong on protecting the property rights of all Americans.  In industry
meetings with Lt. Governor Frank Brogan and in a meeting with Mark Mays, COO
of Clear Channel, my understanding is that both you and the Lt. Governor
indicated your support of this important issue.

Governor, in my 50 years of working in the outdoor advertising business, our
industry has never encountered the battles to protect our property that we
have in Florida in the last twenty years.  I cannot begin to tell you what
we have spent on legal bills in Florida, but it is in the millions of
dollars.  We need this legislation to maintain our assets.  We are only
asking to protect what was legally and lawfully constructed in your state.

We have heard that you have concerns that the Transportation Bill became a
"train."  Please, we implore you, do not send a message on "trains" by
vetoing this bill.  Our legislation was heard in eight separate committee
hearings, and four sessions of the full House and Senate.  My understanding
is that the late amendments to the transportation bill contain no
substantive controversial provisions.

The affect of a veto would cause irreparable damage to our company.  Eller
employees approximately 300 people in Florida and has annual sales over One
Hundred Million Dollars.  I am strongly urging your support of our viable
business by asking you to sign the Transportation Bill, CS/CS/3rdEng/H 1053.

Thank you for your consideration.

PLO5 The Capitol

Tallahassee, FL 32300-0001

re: VETO of HB1157

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today to request that you veto HB1157. The language in
the bill pertaining to the waiver of public notice for fictitious name
filings significantly impacts the public's right to know.

If implementation of the other provisions is delayed until next year's early
session, the impact will be minimal. But, the impact on public notice is
virtually irrevocable.

An issue this important should not be passed as a floor amendment in the
last days of session but rather deserves the full attention of the
legislature and deserves to be subjected to the full legislative process. A
veto of this bill would have no impact on existing business and minimal
impact on a new business.

My family has been publishing newspapers in Florida since 1912 and we have
always recognized and embraced technological advances.

Like other publishers I'm not opposed to the internet as a supplement to
printed legal notice. In fact my papers post notices simultaneously on the
internet at no cost.
 
Bill Gates recently told the student body at Georgetown University when
discussing his book "Business At The Speed Of Thought" that "the internet
was not designed to replace newspapers". We agree.

We need to look beyond the impact on individual business or industry and
focus on a responsible partnership between those charged with keeping the
public informed. This will assure that the public's right to know is not
only maintained but enhanced.

The foundation of peoples trust in government hinges on their leaders'
commitment to keep citizens informed. The passage of this legislation
impinges the source of access to public information. Therefor I urge you to
veto HB1157.

Good evening Governor! 

I got a message this evening that you are considering a veto related to 
SB1284. As a family law practitioner in the State of Florida, I would urge 
you not to do that- rather, despite a pilot project that I feel is ill 
advised, I would urge you to sign it as it contains necessary reform that is 
long overdue. 

Two years back an ill advised bill was run by then Representative Steve 
Effman. That bill mandated a deviation from the charted child support 
guidelines figure where a child spent an undefined "substantial time" with 
both parents based upon a series of factors that were indefinite and, 
according to several economists, impossible. You were ready to veto the bill- 
in fact, we were told that the veto message was already drafted, but Rep. 
Effman promised to fix it the following year. If you recall, you had letters 
from Judges throughout the State urging a veto as the factors were impossible 
and the standards imprecise. What is "substantial time" in one county- or 
with one judge- is a far cry from what another deemed substantial so once 
again what support was ordered depended upon who the judge was and, even more 
tragically, settlement became harder as the uncertainty of what child support 
would be awarded if parents choose to share their children's lives became a 
reality. 

The Family Law Section of the Florida Bar, in concert with several other 
organizations and with the input of both our member judges and other members 
of the judiciary recognized that there did need to be a fix to this problem 
that would do what most states do- set a formula that would be uniformly 
applied. After great debate, the current language (which was presented and 
debated in both houses) was adopted as a necessary proposal. The scheme is 
that where a child spends more than 40% of the time with each parent there 
would be statutorily mandated deviation from the charted guidelines based 
upon a precise formula that first enhances the charted amount since both 
homes will require full facilities for the child(ren) and then divides the 
child's expense needs between the parents- and that if there was less than 
40% but still substantial time with each then deviation would be 
discretionary if the time spent with the secondary residential parent reduced 
the expenses of the primary. This procedure promotes certainty in award- 
while still allowing flexibility to the court. We believe that it is in the 
best interests of the children. 

We understand that the Commission on Responsible Fatherhood would rather this 
issue be debated as part of a general overhaul of child support through a 
child support commission. I agree that a commission would be wonderful and is 
long overdue- but its hopeful establishment in the future is not a reason not 
to fix a real problem that we in the field recognize exists now. I would 
strongly urge you to have the establishment of a child support commission be   
one of the things you consider as part of your legislative agenda next year- 
but don't delay this fix in the interim. We need it. 

Further, there are other components of the bill that are necessary- there are 
changes dealing with the date of modification necessary to achieve fairness, 
the authority of a court to use income deduction orders for temporary relief 
to get children child support during the divorce process itself in a secure 
regular manner, and some changes in terminology that DOR advised us were 
federally mandated. As I said, there is a pilot project I could easily live 
without- but overall the passage of this bill promotes significant positive 
reform. It includes the fix that was promised when the bill creating the 
problem was signed rather than vetoed. Please sign this one, it is important. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or have Brian call me 
tomorrow. I will be out of my office- so here is the portable- 305-710-3865. 

Thank you for your attention.

Importance: High


Governor/Kathleen/Pam:

Visit Florida's advertising agency, Fahlgren Agency (based in Tampa) hired
production company, November Inc., out of SANTA MONICA,CA to shoot their new
commercial promoting Florida tourism.  No, I can't believe that they would
do that either considering that the Visit Florida COO is an ex-officio
member of the Florida Film Advisory Council.

Anyway, a fire has started within the Florida film industry regarding this
issue. When Visit Florida was contacted by Katie Waters, former president of
Women In Film - Florida Chapter regarding this issue, a representative of
Visit Florida indicated that they made a "business decision" in hiring an
out of state company. While most in the industry will defend the right of a
client to hire whomever they please - when the money to pay the bills comes
from the taxpayers there must be higher standards.

Of the 17 below the line "craft" professionals hired, 2 are from Los
Angeles, 6 are Floridians and 9 are from CANADA.  (these numbers came from a
third party who was counting heads - and area codes - off of a call sheet -
please forgive me if they are not perfect - they are close)  The camera
package is from Canada, Continental Film Lab in Orlando is processing
dailies.

This situation is not new. The jobs for this commercial are not only leaving
the state, but are leaving the country. It is nearly impossible for an
American below the liner to work in Canada, yet they are welcomed here. Why
isn't there reciprocity for US workers in Canada? (although that is a
Federal issue).

It is my understanding that the Orlando Sentinel (reporter Chris Boyd
407-420-5723 cboyd@orlandosentinel.com), Orlando Business Journal (Cindy
Barth /cbarth@bizjournals.com) and WESH Ch 2 are all doing stories on this
job.  WESH  is looking for people who will go on camera to comment and the
Sentinel is currently interviewing for a story tentitively scheduled to be
published on Thursday.

My position on this is to strongly urge Visit Florida to reconsider their
selection of the California-based production company, if not this particular
shoot completely until a more favorable arrangement can be made with a
Florida-based company, with Florida-based crews.

The House Tourism Committee is aware of this issue, and you may begin to
receive emails from constituents.

Bud Nocera, COO Visit Florida, and ex-officio member of the Florida Film
Advisory Council has been contacted by numerous angry industry types.
According to Katie Waters who spoke w/Bud directly, he was "terribly
embarrassed" and "livid" at the Fahlgren Agency's hiring practices.  In his
opinion the agency hired to do the spots "really screwed up".  When Bud
beeped in on the conversation with Ms. Waters, she was on with Tom Flanigan
(who works for Bud at Visit
Florida) who told her that the Fahlgren Agency had told Visit Florida early
on that they were booking a California production company and Canadian crew.


Flanigan said he wasn't concerned at the time (even made sure to warn
Fahlgren to make sure everything was legal - i.e. Canadian crew) and didn't
ask Fahlgren to reconsider, so it must not have seemed unseemly.  What is
the truth here?

You've read my position above.  If you all approve, I will communicate this

Governor/Kathleen/Pam:

Visit Florida's advertising agency, Fahlgren Agency (based in Tampa) hired
production company, November Inc., out of SANTA MONICA,CA to shoot their new
commercial promoting Florida tourism.  No, I can't believe that they would
do that either considering that the Visit Florida COO is an ex-officio
member of the Florida Film Advisory Council.

Anyway, a fire has started within the Florida film industry regarding this
issue. When Visit Florida was contacted by Katie Waters, former president of
Women In Film - Florida Chapter regarding this issue, a representative of
Visit Florida indicated that they made a "business decision" in hiring an
out of state company. While most in the industry will defend the right of a
client to hire whomever they please - when the money to pay the bills comes
from the taxpayers there must be higher standards.

Of the 17 below the line "craft" professionals hired, 2 are from Los
Angeles, 6 are Floridians and 9 are from CANADA.  (these numbers came from a
third party who was counting heads - and area codes - off of a call sheet -
please forgive me if they are not perfect - they are close)  The camera
package is from Canada, Continental Film Lab in Orlando is processing
dailies.

This situation is not new. The jobs for this commercial are not only leaving
the state, but are leaving the country. It is nearly impossible for an
American below the liner to work in Canada, yet they are welcomed here. Why
isn't there reciprocity for US workers in Canada? (although that is a
Federal issue).

It is my understanding that the Orlando Sentinel (reporter Chris Boyd
407-420-5723 cboyd@orlandosentinel.com), Orlando Business Journal (Cindy
Barth /cbarth@bizjournals.com) and WESH Ch 2 are all doing stories on this
job.  WESH  is looking for people who will go on camera to comment and the
Sentinel is currently interviewing for a story tentitively scheduled to be
published on Thursday.

My position on this is to strongly urge Visit Florida to reconsider their
selection of the California-based production company, if not this particular
shoot completely until a more favorable arrangement can be made with a
Florida-based company, with Florida-based crews.

Good evening Governor! 

I got a message this evening that you are considering a veto related to 
SB1284. As a family law practitioner in the State of Florida, I would urge 
you not to do that- rather, despite a pilot project that I feel is ill 
advised, I would urge you to sign it as it contains necessary reform that is 
long overdue. 

Two years back an ill advised bill was run by then Representative Steve 
Effman. That bill mandated a deviation from the charted child support 
guidelines figure where a child spent an undefined "substantial time" with 
both parents based upon a series of factors that were indefinite and, 
according to several economists, impossible. You were ready to veto the bill- 
in fact, we were told that the veto message was already drafted, but Rep. 
Effman promised to fix it the following year. If you recall, you had letters 
from Judges throughout the State urging a veto as the factors were impossible 
and the standards imprecise. What is "substantial time" in one county- or 
with one judge- is a far cry from what another deemed substantial so once 
again what support was ordered depended upon who the judge was and, even more 
tragically, settlement became harder as the uncertainty of what child support 
would be awarded if parents choose to share their children's lives became a 
reality. 

The Family Law Section of the Florida Bar, in concert with several other 
organizations and with the input of both our member judges and other members 
of the judiciary recognized that there did need to be a fix to this problem 
that would do what most states do- set a formula that would be uniformly 
applied. After great debate, the current language (which was presented and 
debated in both houses) was adopted as a necessary proposal. The scheme is 
that where a child spends more than 40% of the time with each parent there 
would be statutorily mandated deviation from the charted guidelines based 
upon a precise formula that first enhances the charted amount since both 
homes will require full facilities for the child(ren) and then divides the 
child's expense needs between the parents- and that if there was less than 
40% but still substantial time with each then deviation would be 
discretionary if the time spent with the secondary residential parent reduced 
the expenses of the primary. This procedure promotes certainty in award- 
while still allowing flexibility to the court. We believe that it is in the 
best interests of the children. 

We understand that the Commission on Responsible Fatherhood would rather this 
issue be debated as part of a general overhaul of child support through a 
child support commission. I agree that a commission would be wonderful and is 
long overdue- but its hopeful establishment in the future is not a reason not 
to fix a real problem that we in the field recognize exists now. I would 
strongly urge you to have the establishment of a child support commission be   
one of the things you consider as part of your legislative agenda next year- 
but don't delay this fix in the interim. We need it. 

Further, there are other components of the bill that are necessary- there are 
changes dealing with the date of modification necessary to achieve fairness, 
the authority of a court to use income deduction orders for temporary relief 
to get children child support during the divorce process itself in a secure 
regular manner, and some changes in terminology that DOR advised us were 
federally mandated. As I said, there is a pilot project I could easily live 
without- but overall the passage of this bill promotes significant positive 
reform. It includes the fix that was promised when the bill creating the 
problem was signed rather than vetoed. Please sign this one, it is important. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or have Brian call me 
tomorrow. I will be out of my office- so here is the portable- 305-710-3865. 

Thank you for your attention.

reality. 

The Family Law Section of the Florida Bar, in concert with several other 
organizations and with the input of both our member judges and other members 
of the judiciary recognized that there did need to be a fix to this problem 
that would do what most states do- set a formula that would be uniformly 
applied. After great debate, the current language (which was presented and 
debated in both houses) was adopted as a necessary proposal. The scheme is 
that where a child spends more than 40% of the time with each parent there 
would be statutorily mandated deviation from the charted guidelines based 
upon a precise formula that first enhances the charted amount since both 
homes will require full facilities for the child(ren) and then divides the 
child's expense needs between the parents- and that if there was less than 
40% but still substantial time with each then deviation would be 
discretionary if the time spent with the secondary residential parent reduced 
the expenses of the primary. This procedure promotes certainty in award- 
while still allowing flexibility to the court. We believe that it is in the 
best interests of the children. 

We understand that the Commission on Responsible Fatherhood would rather this 
issue be debated as part of a general overhaul of child support through a 
child support commission. I agree that a commission would be wonderful and is 
long overdue- but its hopeful establishment in the future is not a reason not 
to fix a real problem that we in the field recognize exists now. I would 
strongly urge you to have the establishment of a child support commission be   
one of the things you consider as part of your legislative agenda next year- 
but don't delay this fix in the interim. We need it. 

Further, there are other components of the bill that are necessary- there are 
changes dealing with the date of modification necessary to achieve fairness, 
the authority of a court to use income deduction orders for temporary relief 
to get children child support during the divorce process itself in a secure 
regular manner, and some changes in terminology that DOR advised us were 
federally mandated. As I said, there is a pilot project I could easily live 
without- but overall the passage of this bill promotes significant positive 
reform. It includes the fix that was promised when the bill creating the 
problem was signed rather than vetoed. Please sign this one, it is important. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or have Brian call me 
tomorrow. I will be out of my office- so here is the portable- 305-710-3865.

Subject: Visit Florida Tourism Commercial
Importance: High


Governor/Kathleen/Pam:

Visit Florida's advertising agency, Fahlgren Agency (based in Tampa) hired
production company, November Inc., out of SANTA MONICA,CA to shoot their new
commercial promoting Florida tourism.  No, I can't believe that they would
do that either considering that the Visit Florida COO is an ex-officio
member of the Florida Film Advisory Council.

Anyway, a fire has started within the Florida film industry regarding this
issue. When Visit Florida was contacted by Katie Waters, former president of
Women In Film - Florida Chapter regarding this issue, a representative of
Visit Florida indicated that they made a "business decision" in hiring an
out of state company. While most in the industry will defend the right of a
client to hire whomever they please - when the money to pay the bills comes
from the taxpayers there must be higher standards.  

Of the 17 below the line "craft" professionals hired, 2 are from Los
Angeles, 6 are Floridians and 9 are from CANADA.  (these numbers came from a
third party who was counting heads - and area codes - off of a call sheet -
please forgive me if they are not perfect - they are close)  The camera
package is from Canada, Continental Film Lab in Orlando is processing
dailies.

This situation is not new. The jobs for this commercial are not only leaving
the state, but are leaving the country. It is nearly impossible for an
American below the liner to work in Canada, yet they are welcomed here. Why
isn't there reciprocity for US workers in Canada? (although that is a
Federal issue).

It is my understanding that the Orlando Sentinel (reporter Chris Boyd
407-420-5723 cboyd@orlandosentinel.com), Orlando Business Journal (Cindy
Barth /cbarth@bizjournals.com) and WESH Ch 2 are all doing stories on this
job.  WESH  is looking for people who will go on camera to comment and the
Sentinel is currently interviewing for a story tentitively scheduled to be
published on Thursday.

My position on this is to strongly urge Visit Florida to reconsider their
selection of the California-based production company, if not this particular
shoot completely until a more favorable arrangement can be made with a
Florida-based company, with Florida-based crews.

The House Tourism Committee is aware of this issue, and you may begin to
receive emails from constituents.  

Bud Nocera, COO Visit Florida, and ex-officio member of the Florida Film
Advisory Council has been contacted by numerous angry industry types.
According to Katie Waters who spoke w/Bud directly, he was "terribly
embarrassed" and "livid" at the Fahlgren Agency's hiring practices.  In his
opinion the agency hired to do the spots "really screwed up".  When Bud
beeped in on the conversation with Ms. Waters, she was on with Tom Flanigan
(who works for Bud at Visit 
Florida) who told her that the Fahlgren Agency had told Visit Florida early
on that they were booking a California production company and Canadian crew.


Flanigan said he wasn't concerned at the time (even made sure to warn
Fahlgren to make sure everything was legal - i.e. Canadian crew) and didn't
ask Fahlgren to reconsider, so it must not have seemed unseemly.  What is
the truth here?

You've read my position above.  If you all approve, I will communicate this
to Bud/Visit Florida. If not, please let me know how you'd like to handle.

Thanks,

Dear Governor Bush, There are rare opportunities in any great institution's history when all the necessary components are aligned to enable great progress.  I feel that we are at that precise moment  for the Ringling Museum.  For sixty years the museum has languished as the State of Florida Museum.  We now have a visionary FSU President, a resourceful  and broad reaching board, an energetic and knowledgeable new director,  a major donor who can make our circus collection the finest in the world, and  the leadership and support of a  Senate President. We have a plan to complete the "package" of the Ringling Museum, to make each facet of this jewel shine, a treasure the state can be proud of.   You are the catalyst. We can't do it without you!

I am a member of the Board of Directors for the Ringling Museum, and I am
completing a second term as such.  Over the years that I have been directly
involved with the Ringling Museum I have worked hard to overcome the
tragedy of underfunding and subsequent deterioration of this wonderful
resource.  Bringing the Museum under the auspices of FSU was a bold move
seen as the only way to end the slow strangulation of Florida's Art Museum.
The fruition of that vision is in the appropriations in the current
legislation, beginning the process of making the John and Mable Ringling
Museum of Art the world class show case it can be.

I have just completed a three week tour of the Czech Republic, Slovak
Republic, Hungary, Austria and what used to be east Germany. ( I was
stationed in West Germany in the 60's as part of my military service and
saw how the western European countries rebuilt themselves.  While they had
many many problems of infrastructure rebuilding, health concerns, education
, transportation, etc, they set a priority of restoring and preserving
their museums, educational institutions, archives and libraries.)  Now I
see the recently liberated countries and areas of Eastern Europe setting
the same priorities to preserve and protect their cultural and historical
heritages. Surely, as Americans we can't ignore our own cultural and
historical institutions!

The Ringling Museum is an important part of our cultural and historical
resources.  Please let it get back on track.

Greetings from FSU! I hope that all is well downtown!

I wanted to first of all thank you for your support of voting right's for
the Student Body President's on the Board of Trustees and I look forward to
you signing the bill. I am really excited about the new Board and I think
it's going to greatly improve FSU and well as the entire SUS. When are you

On another higher education note I wanted to urge your VETO of the Tuition
increase passed by the Legislature. I think it is ridiculous that today's
students are going to be taxed for future enrollment. The student's that
would be paying for this tuition increase would never see the direct results
and thus I feel this increase is not beneficial to the Florida State student
body at this time. So I am asking you to please VETO the tuition increase.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration on this matter. Keep up
the good work. Take care and God Bless.

Good evening Governor! 

I got a message this evening that you are considering a veto related to 
SB1284. As a family law practitioner in the State of Florida, I would urge 
you not to do that- rather, despite a pilot project that I feel is ill 
advised, I would urge you to sign it as it contains necessary reform that is 
long overdue. 

Two years back an ill advised bill was run by then Representative Steve 
Effman. That bill mandated a deviation from the charted child support 
guidelines figure where a child spent an undefined "substantial time" with 
both parents based upon a series of factors that were indefinite and, 
according to several economists, impossible. You were ready to veto the bill- 
in fact, we were told that the veto message was already drafted, but Rep. 
Effman promised to fix it the following year. If you recall, you had letters 
from Judges throughout the State urging a veto as the factors were impossible 
and the standards imprecise. What is "substantial time" in one county- or 
with one judge- is a far cry from what another deemed substantial so once 
again what support was ordered depended upon who the judge was and, even more 
tragically, settlement became harder as the uncertainty of what child support 
would be awarded if parents choose to share their children's lives became a 
reality. 

The Family Law Section of the Florida Bar, in concert with several other 
organizations and with the input of both our member judges and other members

that would do what most states do- set a formula that would be uniformly

Thanks for your quick response. Please indulge me once more by letting me put in a plug for Sheriff Scott Lancaster for FHP Director. I've already talked to Fred about him and set up the initial appointment for them to talk. His only problem, to my knowledge, is that many people thing we look alike. I, of course, am much better looking. Having him in Tallahassee may help me to shift the blame for some of my bad ways, to him.

Hope you won't take this as me sticking my nose in where I should not. Being
involved dailey with the Leon County Commission, I have a pretty good view
of the turmoil they are in. In my opinion they need a replacement for Rudy
Maloy who will be able to hit the ground running. I submit that Manny Joanos
is the only local "R" who fits the bill. He is a good friend, a good family
man, and is well respected by the community, to my knowledge.
I think that Manny would be an appointee who would stand a very strong
chanch of being elected when the election is set. If I can provide any
specific info please hollar and I'll give you all I know.
Thanks,
Larry

We will see what we can find out about this.  It sounds crazy to me.  There is a law---sec. 743.015, Fla. Stat.---which sets up a process under which a minor age 16 or older may petition a circuit court through a guardian ad litem for an order removing the "disabilities of nonage."  I would guess that this statute was used---or misused--- in this case.  The minor's natural parents would have to be notified of the petition, and they could object at the hearing.  But the judge could grant the petition notwithstanding the objections of the parents.

Yesterday I drove to Bradenton for a double header after driving Friday and Saturday to Winter Haven for Harrison's tournament.  Ben's coach's brother is the assistant coach and I chatted yesterday with his wife for several hours.  They live in Apopka I think.  Anyway.....................
 
She proceeded to tell me about 2.5 years of absolute hell that they went through with their oldest daughter.  She was an honor roll student who at the age of 15 got mixed up with  a drug ring in Orlando.  At sixteen she decided to move out of her parents house so she told the court she was pregnant.  The judge allowed her to move out of her parents home and in with drug dealers on her word.  Her parents could not legally intervene.  They could not get her pregnancy tested neither could they have her drug tested.  The DCF was on their side and they hired an attorney, but the judge ruled that they had no parental rights.
 
After the kid moved in with the dealers they hid her on the Orange Blossom Trail for 7 months and her parents could not find her, thanks to the ruling of the court..  They finally got a sheriff over there to make her a priority  and found her.  She was court ordered into treatment because she was crack addict and she brought down a whole ring of dealers and thieves in Orlando, some of whom were important people over there.
 
How can our state laws be that screwed up?  I told she should sit down with their state legislators, but she said no one is interested.  She's written letters to everyone over there, even to your office and gotten nowhere.  I was shocked.  They spent thousands of dollars on attorneys, investigators to try to find their daughter and correct what the court had done.   I can't really relate the whole story but it's unbelievable.

Subject:	Visit Florida Tourism Commercial

Importance:	High

Governor/Kathleen/Pam:

Visit Florida's advertising agency, Fahlgren Agency (based in Tampa) hired
production company, November Inc., out of SANTA MONICA,CA to shoot their new
commercial promoting Florida tourism.  No, I can't believe that they would
do that either considering that the Visit Florida COO is an ex-officio
member of the Florida Film Advisory Council.

Anyway, a fire has started within the Florida film industry regarding this
issue. When Visit Florida was contacted by Katie Waters, former president of
Women In Film - Florida Chapter regarding this issue, a representative of
Visit Florida indicated that they made a "business decision" in hiring an
out of state company. While most in the industry will defend the right of a
client to hire whomever they please - when the money to pay the bills comes
from the taxpayers there must be higher standards.  

Of the 17 below the line "craft" professionals hired, 2 are from Los
Angeles, 6 are Floridians and 9 are from CANADA.  (these numbers came from a
third party who was counting heads - and area codes - off of a call sheet -
please forgive me if they are not perfect - they are close)  The camera
package is from Canada, Continental Film Lab in Orlando is processing
dailies.

This situation is not new. The jobs for this commercial are not only leaving
the state, but are leaving the country. It is nearly impossible for an
American below the liner to work in Canada, yet they are welcomed here. Why
isn't there reciprocity for US workers in Canada? (although that is a
Federal issue).

It is my understanding that the Orlando Sentinel (reporter Chris Boyd
407-420-5723 cboyd@orlandosentinel.com), Orlando Business Journal (Cindy
Barth /cbarth@bizjournals.com) and WESH Ch 2 are all doing stories on this
job.  WESH  is looking for people who will go on camera to comment and the
Sentinel is currently interviewing for a story tentitively scheduled to be
published on Thursday.

My position on this is to strongly urge Visit Florida to reconsider their
selection of the California-based production company, if not this particular
shoot completely until a more favorable arrangement can be made with a
Florida-based company, with Florida-based crews.

The House Tourism Committee is aware of this issue, and you may begin to
receive emails from constituents.  

Bud Nocera, COO Visit Florida, and ex-officio member of the Florida Film
Advisory Council has been contacted by numerous angry industry types.
According to Katie Waters who spoke w/Bud directly, he was "terribly
embarrassed" and "livid" at the Fahlgren Agency's hiring practices.  In his
opinion the agency hired to do the spots "really screwed up".  When Bud
beeped in on the conversation with Ms. Waters, she was on with Tom Flanigan
(who works for Bud at Visit 
Florida) who told her that the Fahlgren Agency had told Visit Florida early
on that they were booking a California production company and Canadian crew.


Flanigan said he wasn't concerned at the time (even made sure to warn
Fahlgren to make sure everything was legal - i.e. Canadian crew) and didn't
ask Fahlgren to reconsider, so it must not have seemed unseemly.  What is
the truth here?

You've read my position above.  If you all approve, I will communicate this
to Bud/Visit Florida. If not, please let me know how you'd like to handle.

Thanks,

According to news reports, Paul Bilzerian is an ex-corporate raider. 8 years
ago, the SEC won a $62 million judgement against him for securities fraud.
The agency has not received a penny, nor have any of his other creditors.
He now owes the SEC over $100 million. Bilzerian has filed 2 separate
bankruptcy proceedings, claiming he is poor with just over $15,000 to his
name.  However, he owns the largest house in Hillsborough County (a 36,000
sf mansion w/ a 6000 sf guest house).  In 1998, the federalbankruptcy court
ruled the debt could not be discharged in bankruptcy and ordered Bilzerian
to pay. When he couldn't, the court ordered him to disclose his assets.  In
2000, the court ruled that Bilzerian did not demonstrate an inability to
pay, concealed assets and held him in contempt of court.  In January of
2001, the Federal Judge ordered Bilzerian to submit to federal marshals to
be held in federal prison until he provides a satisfactory accounting of his
assets.  He surrendered to federal marshals on January 30, and remains in
federal custody.

Subject:	Lionel Tate -Clemency Matter - Confidential

Governor Bush,

The Department of Juvenile Justice provided the following information
regarding Lionel Tate's conduct while incarcerated at the Okeechobee
Juvenile Offender Correction Center (OJOCC). The information includes
disciplinary reports, mental health evaluations, and his most recent
Performance Summary.  The information regarding his conduct while awaiting
trial was furnished by the Broward County Sheriff's Office.

Disciplinary Reports
To date, Lionel Tate has received 15 disciplinary reports while housed at
OJOCC. The disciplinary reports involve overt defiance, horseplay, fighting
with peers, cursing, and kicking a staff member twice in the side during a
restraint procedure.  

While in the custody of the Broward County Sheriff's Office, Tate received 2
written disciplinary reports: one for horseplay, the other for chasing
another inmate around a table and threatening him with a pencil.  As to the
latter report, Lionel alleges that the other boy struck him in the face
first.

Mental Health Evaluations
 Lionel Tate's mental health therapy has included psychiatry, psychology and
substance abuse assessment and counseling.

Psychiatric Notes
Dr. Borromeo's psychiatric notes reveal that Lionel is "very cocky in his
attitude toward authority, giving others the impression that no one can do
anything to him."  During an interview with Lionel regarding his
disciplinary problems, Lionel stated, "I just don't like how they do things
here, and I'm not going to do what they say." 

Dr. Borromeo recently diagnosed Lionel with ADHD (Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder) and recommended he be treated with Adderal.

Psychological Notes
Dr. Abuso's psychological notes reveal that as late as May 17, 2002, Lionel
failed to demonstrate any meaningful level of remorse for the crime
committed. The doctor noted that he would continue the process of seeking
empathy in Lionel as a fundamental element to any lasting change or growth.

Dr. Abuso also noted that Lionel demonstrates remarkably poor impulse
control skills and has little or no insight into his immediate or long-term
situation.  He describes "pretentiousness" as the hallmark of Lionel's
worldview making therapeutic intervention difficult.  Additionally, Dr.
Abuso states that Lionel's insight to the issues behind his conduct and to
the implications of his poor choices is severely limited, which could well
produce "dire consequences" in terms of legal status and his chance for
success following incarceration.

Performance Summary
Overall, Lionel has made very little progress. Although he has shown some
progress in two areas:  mental health/substance abuse and medical/dental
services, in other areas he has shown little or no progress. Progress in
mental health/substance abuse and medical/dental services include continuing
to participate in and making an effort to have successful therapy sessions,
as well as losing weight, a total of 3 lbs., since being placed on a diet by
the medical staff.  He has shown no progress and remains seriously deficient
in the areas of social skills, life skills, behavioral development,
adjustment to the program, interaction with peers, and interaction with
staff, as evidenced by 8 disciplinary reports and 29 negative entries in his
contact card over a 30 day period.  Additionally, Lionel needs improvement
in the areas of recreational development (has trouble keeping his hands to
himself), family development (placed in segregation due to disciplinary
problems and therefore unable to make weekly phone calls), and academic
competency (Math "C", Language "F", Horticulture "C", Computer Science "B",
and JROTC "D").


The information provided by the Department of Juvenile Justice is
confidential.  It has been provided to you for the purpose of evaluating
Lionel Tate's request for a waiver of the Rules of Executive Clemency.
Accordingly, at this time the information should not be commented on
publicly.

On another higher education note I wanted to urge your VETO of the Tuition

Katie, here are our estimates for the Florida impacts of what Congress passed.  Please note that these are preliminary numbers.  Our own estimates will change some as we get a more complete understanding about the administrative details of the federal changes.  Also, be aware that other people may also be working on estimates that may go public.  Nevertheless, I think that these estimates are certainly in the ball park and tell a reasonably accurate story as to the effects on Florida.

I have received several phone calls from the Telecommunications guys

plan a bill signing ceremony for the Tax Simplification bill.  They have 
their annual conference on June 10th thru the 12th and I am their keynote 
speaker on one of those days and they would like to report to their 
membership the status of the bill (they would actually prefer a "signing" 
before the Conference.    Please let me know what I can tell them.

Thanks for your quick response. Please indulge me once more by letting me put in a plug for Sheriff Scott Lancaster for FHP Director. I've already talked to Fred about him and set up the initial appointment for them to talk. His only problem, to my knowledge, is that many people thing we look alike. I, of course, am much better looking. Having him in Tallahassee may help me to shift the blame for some of my bad ways, to him.

Hope you won't take this as me sticking my nose in where I should not. Being
involved dailey with the Leon County Commission, I have a pretty good view
of the turmoil they are in. In my opinion they need a replacement for Rudy
Maloy who will be able to hit the ground running. I submit that Manny Joanos
is the only local "R" who fits the bill. He is a good friend, a good family
man, and is well respected by the community, to my knowledge.
I think that Manny would be an appointee who would stand a very strong
chanch of being elected when the election is set. If I can provide any
specific info please hollar and I'll give you all I know.

We will see what we can find out about this.  It sounds crazy to me.  There is a law---sec. 743.015, Fla. Stat.---which sets up a process under which a minor age 16 or older may petition a circuit court through a guardian ad litem for an order removing the "disabilities of nonage."  I would guess that this statute was used---or misused--- in this case.  The minor's natural parents would have to be notified of the petition, and they could object at the hearing.  But the judge could grant the petition notwithstanding the objections of the parents.

Yesterday I drove to Bradenton for a double header after driving Friday and Saturday to Winter Haven for Harrison's tournament.  Ben's coach's brother is the assistant coach and I chatted yesterday with his wife for several hours.  They live in Apopka I think.  Anyway.....................
 
She proceeded to tell me about 2.5 years of absolute hell that they went through with their oldest daughter.  She was an honor roll student who at the age of 15 got mixed up with  a drug ring in Orlando.  At sixteen she decided to move out of her parents house so she told the court she was pregnant.  The judge allowed her to move out of her parents home and in with drug dealers on her word.  Her parents could not legally intervene.  They could not get her pregnancy tested neither could they have her drug tested.  The DCF was on their side and they hired an attorney, but the judge ruled that they had no parental rights.
 
After the kid moved in with the dealers they hid her on the Orange Blossom Trail for 7 months and her parents could not find her, thanks to the ruling of the court..  They finally got a sheriff over there to make her a priority  and found her.  She was court ordered into treatment because she was crack addict and she brought down a whole ring of dealers and thieves in Orlando, some of whom were important people over there.
 
How can our state laws be that screwed up?  I told she should sit down with their state legislators, but she said no one is interested.  She's written letters to everyone over there, even to your office and gotten nowhere.  I was shocked.  They spent thousands of dollars on attorneys, investigators to try to find their daughter and correct what the court had done.   I can't really relate the whole story but it's unbelievable.

Hey, Pam.
 
I spoke with Ward Brewer and advised him I was following up at the request of the Governor's office.
 
I listened to Ward Brewer for almost an hour and heard about plans ranging from forest firefighting to oceanographic rescue and research to building a soundstage for making training films.  He is going to send me more information.  I asked him how many employees he had at Pensacola Bay EMAC.  Answer: zero, but 60 volunteers.  Checked with D&B and they have nothing on Pensacola Bay EMAC.  Spoke with Mike Frey and gathered some info better left to a phone conversation.

Governor, 

I was asked by Sen. Peaden's office to forward this information to you concerning a project we are currently working on that will be of significant educational and financial benefit to both the Panhandle and the State of Florida. 


You may remember our organization. We met briefly when your cabinet passed a resolution recognizing those of us who were awarded the Sustainable Florida Awards for 2000.  We had been asked by DEP for assistance to obtain evidence for what became  the Garcon Point Bridge Case.  Our work not only built the case evidence that DEP needed to involve EPA and  US DOJ, but also saved DEP more than $50K in underwater side scan and diver/photographic operations.  Today, we are providing high technology support for other state agencies including the Florida Highway Patrol.  By providing state and federal agencies with  technological support that is currently not available to them, we are saving tax dollars and better assisting them in accomplishing their missions. 


We are now in the process of deciding where to locate our corporate headquarters.  Our partnerships include:  IBM (providing our super computer facility and wireless technology), John Deere, Oshkosh Trucks,  Constant Technologies, Scandicraft/SAAB of Sweden, LDV, Home Depot, and Tyco, University of Florida, and Auburn University, among others. 


Senator Peaden and his office have been very helpful when we recently informed them about our intentions.  The attached PHM project is important to the Panhandle and Florida, not only from an educational standpoint, but from a high technology and promotional aspect as well.   As I have lived and worked in Florida over 6 years,  relocation to Alabama to build a corporate business is not my first choice.  However, Alabama has offered to help us secure funding for the PHM project if we will locate our offices to Baldwin, Mobile or Escambia County.  Please see the attached file on the PHM's to better understand their capabilities and importance. 


Pensacola Bay EMAC is in the process of implementing a three year $150 million corporate program.  We will employ 200+ with an average salary of $36,000, full insurance and a 401k program.  This will bring with it significant educational benefits and national/international recognition to the region.  Employment of the disabled is also a priority with us. 


What we need is to obtain assistance in securing donors, sponsors, etc.  to enable us to purchase the PHM vessels at this time so that they are not scrapped.  We have been granted an extension of a few weeks, however, our organization must commit to a contract soon. 


The owner of the vessels: 


Gregg Enterprises, Inc.. 
616 South14th Street 
Leesburg, FL  34748 


Telephone: 352 365 6522/  Fax  352 787 9559. 
Owner:  F. Browne Gregg 


Please review the enclosed material.  I am sure you will find it of interest.  If there is anything that can be done by your office, we would appreciate the assistance.  Although Pensacola Bay EMAC is not-for-profit, it is the first of several leading high technology  businesses (that are for profit corporations)  I am working with IBM to bring to the region. 


Thank you very much for your time.  This email address will be kept confidential. 


Sincerely, 


Ward W. Brewer II

Pensacola Bay EMAC

Dear Governor Bush,
    Please support the "proviso language" in the Appropriations Bill that
would eliminate the local match for KidCare for one year.
Polk County School District sends out over 80,000 KidCare applications to
our students each fall in conjunction with the Board of County
Commissioners. Since I am the KidCare contact for the Polk School District,
I can tell you that's a lot of applications!

36,254  were enrolled in Florida KidCare Health Insurance in  Polk County
when I created this chart last year.
 <<graph.xls>> 
The waiver of the local match is essential to removing this barrier that
keeps low-income, uninsured children from participating and from receiving
essential health care services.

Thank you for your consideration to this request.

Dear Governor Bush,

Re:  Leon County Commission Appointment

I am writing to urge you to appoint Kathy Beck to serve as Leon County
Commissioner At Large.  During her 2000 campaign for the District 4 seat,
Mrs. Beck distinguished herself in a strong Republican field with an
unrivaled understanding of County government and how issues play in our
community.  She has the political savvy to work effectively in our
contentious local government environment.

Growth management, as you know from the priority you have appropriately
given it, is the most challenging issue facing local government.  Kathy is
clearly the best choice to help guide our community in this area.  She knows
the issue from the perspective of neighborhood associations and as a real
estate developer.  She knows the vision, the laws, and who they affect and
how.  She understands how the laws and policies interact – and where the
changes need to be made to make growth management work better in our
community.

Kathy is a fiscal conservative.  She knows the County budget, having taken
it apart line-by-line, and the budget process.  Knowing the state of County
finances, she has expressed a strong commitment to work for elimination of
unnecessary duplication of County and City of Tallahassee services through
functional consolidation.  Kathy won’t accept “we’ve always done it that
 way” as an excuse for inefficient government.

From a political perspective, Kathy is well regarded in our community by
folks on both sides of the issues.  She is known and respected by elected
officials and community leaders, would be a stabilizing force on the
Commission, and could run strongly to hold on to the seat.  I believe these
strengths make her a uniquely good fit for an appointment of this nature.

I am sorry that you have to spend your time and energy addressing this
unfortunate situation and I commend you for your expeditious and thorough
approach.  I think your appointment of Kathy Beck would be a positive step
for Leon County and the state.

Thank you for your consideration!

She told me that if a teenager is pregnant that the court can emancipate them from their parents.  But the court didn't even order a pregnancy test, they just took her word for it and she was lying. She was never pregnant and 16 years old.  So they let her move in with drug dealers.
 
(This is another story)  I have another friend whose daughter was in jail since October and just got out.  She has two children, both of whom she has lost because she's a crack addict.  Her live in boyfriend bludgeoned to death his drug dealer in their home.  Long story short I told my friend to ask the judge in N.C. to order her into treatment which he did and Serenity House took the referral.  She's 23 years old and a total wreck and her parents are some of my wealthiest friends.  It is so pitiful!
 
Thank you.  You're so sweet to listen to me.

Yesterday I drove to Bradenton for a double header after driving Friday and Saturday to Winter Haven for Harrison's tournament.  Ben's coach's brother is the assistant coach and I chatted yesterday with his wife for several hours.  They live in Apopka I think.  Anyway.....................
 
She proceeded to tell me about 2.5 years of absolute hell that they went through with their oldest daughter.  She was an honor roll student who at the age of 15 got mixed up with  a drug ring in Orlando.  At sixteen she decided to move out of her parents house so she told the court she was pregnant.  The judge allowed her to move out of her parents home and in with drug dealers on her word.  Her parents could not legally intervene.  They could not get her pregnancy tested neither could they have her drug tested.  The DCF was on their side and they hired an attorney, but the judge ruled that they had no parental rights.
 
After the kid moved in with the dealers they hid her on the Orange Blossom Trail for 7 months and her parents could not find her, thanks to the ruling of the court..  They finally got a sheriff over there to make her a priority  and found her.  She was court ordered into treatment because she was crack addict and she brought down a whole ring of dealers and thieves in Orlando, some of whom were important people over there.
 
How can our state laws be that screwed up?  I told she should sit down with their state legislators, but she said no one is interested.  She's written letters to everyone over there, even to your office and gotten nowhere.  I was shocked.  They spent thousands of dollars on attorneys, investigators to try to find their daughter and correct what the court had done.   I can't really relate the whole story but it's unbelievable.

Subject:	Ringling museum

Dear Sir:
    It has come to my attention that there is a bill pending that would ensure donation of monies proposed for the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida.  I can understand why people advising you might question this allocation, if they are not interested in the arts they might regard the upkeep of the museum as superfluous in the face of so many other needs statewide.
    I am a new docent at the Ringling Museum, and my education and involvement there over the past two years has taught me one thing: the notion that museums are extraneous, that they are an idle pastime for a few educated elite, is an antiquated one.  John Ringling's vision was two-fold, to create a museum that would hold its place worldwide (an idea that everyone thought was ridiculous for an area still so undeveloped), and to create a haven for students.  Today, U.S. News & World Report (June 4, 2001) rates Sarasota as one of the five "Top Towns for the Arts."  People I meet while giving tours have come from all around the world specifically to see the Ringling Museum and are surprised and delighted at the variety of unique treasures to be discovered between the galleries, the circus museum, the Ringlings' fantastic house and the grounds.  But more than all this, Mr. Bush, is what is happening between the museum and the school systems statewide.  My special area of interest is giving school tours, and although I am dimly aware of the great lengths to which the entire staff goes to do so much with so little, I am keenly motivated by the education department's efforts to utilize new trends in museum education.  The museum has given more school tours this year than ever before, and expects to increase next year.  I am constantly aware of what is happening to children as they come in to the galleries, in many cases for the first time in their lives, and are introduced to the adventure of Looking.  This sort of aesthetic experience, and our efforts to make them comfortable with it, to value it as a life skill, affects all areas of learning, not just the discipline of observation and evaluation.  The argument that the arts is not vital to a basic education has faltered even more of late, as I'm sure you're aware.  Consequently, it is not just art students who come to the museum; I have given tours about math, drama, economics, history and religion, and toured with emotionally disturbed as well as gifted students.  Teachers and parents agree that there is no environment that can reproduce a museum: not a classroom, a book or a website.  Who can replace the experience of storytelling with a painting as a guide, or watching a clown put on his makeup, or talking to a lion trainer about how she cares for her cats? Without the funds to maintain and expand the museum, these experiences will shrink and disappear.
    I am sure you have been invited many times to the Ringling Museum, but let me add my voice to others, convinced that if you came to see exactly what the museum is about, you would not only vote in favor of its support, but carry a rich experience home with you as well.
                                                                  Sincerely,    Wendy Marble

She really wants to serve on UCF.  She has no children and her career is her whole life.  With a doctorate in education and 8 years of board service on the Community College level, I think she's qualified to serve on any University board. 
 
While I don't want to malign men, I've noticed that their board attendance is not always dependable.  Her board attendance between PEPC and DBCC was over 90%.  She's only missed meeting for emergency situations.

to no avail as they are primarily interested in high-tech, dotcoms or
bio-tech companies.  My partner and I cannot qualify for an SBA loan, unless
a partner could assist in the project.
We have been in contact with inventpa.com, where the state provides capital
not only for new companies, but also new inventions.
Our product by being made in Florida would increase employment immmediately,
through existing facilities.
More details and photo's are available at www.touchdown-99.com.
Could you please assist in our endeavor to have the most unique football
game in the world be manufactured in Florida.

Bill aims to transfer, not trash signs 
BRAD SMITH of The Tampa Tribune

Billboards or beauty? 

Billboard foes say that's the choice posed by a bill they say would hobble 
attempts to rid Florida's landscape of outdoor advertising. 

But advocates say the pending law aims to relocate signs fairly, not erase 
them. 

Branding it a major defeat for Florida's scenery, opponents are in shock over 
how pro-billboard legislation slid through Tallahassee this year after 
failing to gain traction in previous sessions. 

It passed the House 106-8 and the Senate 39-1. Among the ``no'' voters were 
Hillsborough Rep. Sara Romeo, D-Lutz, and Pinellas Reps. Charlie Justice, 
D-St. Petersburg, and John Carassas, R-Belleair. Sen. Richard Mitchell, 
D-Jasper, the Democratic whip, voted ``no'' in the Senate. Justice said the 
billboard measure was favored by Republican leaders, leaving little doubt it 
would pass without much public debate. 

``I was opposed to the language that took away local control,'' Justice said. 

The lack of debate troubled him. 

``I don't think that's the way anybody wants it. But the leadership can do 
whatever it wants if it has the votes.'' 

William Brinton, a Jacksonville lawyer who fights billboards through Citizens 
for a Scenic Florida, said the pending measure is unusually one-sided in 
favor of a special interest. 

``It was written by the industry for the industry,'' he said. ``If you're not 
an expert in billboard law, you might miss what it's doing.'' 

Enacted May 4 amid a flurry of votes on the 2001 Legislature's last day, the 
bill was tucked into a massive transportation package. 

Bill Peebles, a lobbyist for Tampa, Clearwater, St. Petersburg and 
Jacksonville, called that a tactic to make defeat difficult without scuttling 
major Department of Transportation changes. 

The bill is momentous for governments without billboard bans. It would compel 
cities to bargain with sign owners over relocation, or else pay ``just 
compensation.'' 

But it's expected to have little immediate effect in Hillsborough County, as 
well as Tampa, Clearwater, Jacksonville and several other cities. These have 
legal bans on new billboards or settlements with major sign companies. 

``It does not affect Hillsborough,'' said James Porter, a lawyer for the 
county. ``I believe the legislation specifically exempts people who have 
[legal] agreements with the sign companies.'' 

Gov. Jeb Bush has yet to sign the bill. Spokeswoman Katie Baur said it had 
not been sent to the governor by the Legislature. Bush hasn't taken a 
position on the billboard bill, she said. Once Bush gets it, he will have 15 
days to sign it or veto it. 

Pete Dunbar, chief lobbyist for the Florida Outdoor Advertising Association, 
defended the measure as a way for governments to relocate billboards out of 
scenic areas. He said critics misinterpret how the bill evolved. 

Instead of emphasizing public payment for billboard removals, the bill 
focuses on relocation of signs to less visually offensive spots. 

``It shouldn't cost anybody any money unless you are unable to reach an 
agreement,'' Dunbar said. 

The bill had some politically powerful corporate backing in Tallahassee, 
including Viacom, which owns Infinity Outdoor Inc.; Clear Channel 
Communications, which owns Eller Media Co.; and Lamar Media Corp. As a result 
of corporate buyouts and consolidations, Infinity, Eller and Lamar control 
nearly all of the billboards in Florida and nationwide. 

The bill would force governments to cut deals with private companies or else 
grant hefty payments of $100,000 or more per sign to remove them, according 
to Brinton. 

``This is a huge deal,'' Brinton said. ``It includes the whole industry wish 
list going back to the 1980s.''

Yesterday I drove to Bradenton for a double header after driving Friday and Saturday to Winter Haven for Harrison's tournament.  Ben's coach's brother is the assistant coach and I chatted yesterday with his wife for several hours.  They live in Apopka I think.  Anyway.....................
 
She proceeded to tell me about 2.5 years of absolute hell that they went through with their oldest daughter.  She was an honor roll student who at the age of 15 got mixed up with  a drug ring in Orlando.  At sixteen she decided to move out of her parents house so she told the court she was pregnant.  The judge allowed her to move out of her parents home and in with drug dealers on her word.  Her parents could not legally intervene.  They could not get her pregnancy tested neither could they have her drug tested.  The DCF was on their side and they hired an attorney, but the judge ruled that they had no parental rights.
 
After the kid moved in with the dealers they hid her on the Orange Blossom Trail for 7 months and her parents could not find her, thanks to the ruling of the court..  They finally got a sheriff over there to make her a priority  and found her.  She was court ordered into treatment because she was crack addict and she brought down a whole ring of dealers and thieves in Orlando, some of whom were important people over there.
 
How can our state laws be that screwed up?  I told she should sit down with their state legislators, but she said no one is interested.  She's written letters to everyone over there, even to your office and gotten nowhere.  I was shocked.  They spent thousands of dollars on attorneys, investigators to try to find their daughter and correct what the court had done.   I can't really relate the whole story but it's unbelievable.

Subject:	Leon County Commission Appointment

Dear Governor Bush,

Re:  Leon County Commission Appointment

I am writing to urge you to appoint Kathy Beck to serve as Leon County
Commissioner At Large.  During her 2000 campaign for the District 4 seat,
Mrs. Beck distinguished herself in a strong Republican field with an
unrivaled understanding of County government and how issues play in our
community.  She has the political savvy to work effectively in our
contentious local government environment.

Growth management, as you know from the priority you have appropriately
given it, is the most challenging issue facing local government.  Kathy is
clearly the best choice to help guide our community in this area.  She knows
the issue from the perspective of neighborhood associations and as a real
estate developer.  She knows the vision, the laws, and who they affect and
how.  She understands how the laws and policies interact – and where the
changes need to be made to make growth management work better in our
community.

Kathy is a fiscal conservative.  She knows the County budget, having taken
it apart line-by-line, and the budget process.  Knowing the state of County
finances, she has expressed a strong commitment to work for elimination of
unnecessary duplication of County and City of Tallahassee services through
functional consolidation.  Kathy won’t accept “we’ve always done it that
 way” as an excuse for inefficient government.

From a political perspective, Kathy is well regarded in our community by
folks on both sides of the issues.  She is known and respected by elected
officials and community leaders, would be a stabilizing force on the
Commission, and could run strongly to hold on to the seat.  I believe these
strengths make her a uniquely good fit for an appointment of this nature.

I am sorry that you have to spend your time and energy addressing this
unfortunate situation and I commend you for your expeditious and thorough
approach.  I think your appointment of Kathy Beck would be a positive step
for Leon County and the state.

Thank you for your consideration!

Some info from a conversation that Greg had with Carolyn Snurkowski:  the
Attorney General apparently is not supportive of an expedited consideration
fof Tate's request for clemency.  According to Carolyn, the AG is concerned
about the reports regarding Tate's conduct in custody.  He thinks Tate
should have to wait at least two years before his case is heard.

Dear Gov. Bush: 

As a member of the Child Advocacy Board of Palm Beach County, I am concerned 
that the local match for KidCare will be eliminated for the coming year.  In 
our county, the Health Care District provides a match of $2.5 million.  As a 
concerned citizen and one who has seen first hand the benifits of this

	       We are thrilled to report that late last night, Gov. Bush vetoed SB
1018.  This action is a testimony to his desire to allow parents to
direct the education of their children without unnecessary government
intrusion.  The decision did not come easily, for the Governor received
input from many, many groups.  The process went well into the night, and
the bill was vetoed quite late. The issue of helping parents, of special
needs children, find and obtain necessary services is a valid one, and
there are other pieces of legislation that will aide them in this need.

Your phone calls, letters, and emails made a difference!  From a humble
beginning of just 30 responses, we've heard estimates of a jump to over
900 in just a few days.  Our letters of appreciation are just as
important as our letters of appeal, so please take a moment to thank him
for hearing your concerns and for the decision that he made.

Dear Jeb,

I encourage your support of the "proviso language" in the Appropriations Bill 
that would eliminate the local match to Healthy Kids for one year.  The 
waiver of the local match is essential to removing the bariers that keep 
low-income, uninsured children from receiving essential, consistent  health 
care services.

This past year the coalition in Escambia County spent most of their time raising the $240,000 in local match  when enrollment in our county was frozen.  This was time that could have been much better spent in marketing the Healthy Kids program and enrolling children in it.  

Please do all that you are able to do to eliminate the local match for Healthy Kids.

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush,
Please sign the bill which includes $24 million for the John and Mable 
Ringling Museum of Art. The Museum is the premiere cultural site in all of 
Florida, one of the 15 top art museums in North America in the value of its 
collections.  It is in drastic need of financial aid for delayed maintenance 
as it has been neglected in recent years although the State has owned it 
since 1947.  It gives free admission to all Florida students and teachers and 
is a wonderful educational resource for the whole State.
I voted for you and think you are doing a great job as Governor!

Dear Governor Bush:

As Florida’s State Museum, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art is a vital cultural and economic resource of the Southwestern region of the state you govern. The Museum's new stature under the auspices of Florida State University offers tremendous potential to expand and enhance the quality and variety of cultural attractions offered by the institution. As such the Ringling can be the catalyst and focal point of a growing business in cultural tourism -- a distinct weakness in the cornucopia of attractions currently drawing visitors to the state. Here is an opportunity to cultivate new markets which can generate significant economic benefits for Floridians and for the State of Florida.

You hold the key. Your signature of the current funding bill is critical to realizing this potential. I look forward to your approval of the bill.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	Ringling Museum Appropriations

Dear Governor Bush,
 
First, let me apologize for my computer mishap this morning.   My entire message had been erased and I have rewritten it as follows.
 
For four years I have served on the Ringling Museum Board. For three of those years I would have described the Museum's prospects as "dismal".  Accreditation review was looming ahead (and still is) with no ability to correct cited weaknesses.  Donors were hesitant to give, as they felt the prospects for improvement were poor. Although the C'a D'Zan restoration was underway, the strung out funding of this project caused higher costs, long delays and greater loss of revenue from admissions, which in turn necessitated cutting staff and exhibition plans, a viscious circle.
 
The appropriations package which you have before you, would enable us to bring this jewel into the 21st century.  We could modernize our 1930's style visitor services (ticketing, gift shops, museum restaurant, handicapped facilities, orientation services, audio programs), we could carry out statewide k-12 education programs, we could rebuild the beloved Historic Asolo (currently closed by the fire marshall),
we could match the wonderful gift of Howard Tibbals and create a well endowed new circus museum and family learning center where the history of this great entrpreneurial family, The Ringlings, could be told, we could renovate the West wing of the museum to modern code and efficiency, and lastly, we could enhance this priceless 60+ acres of waterfront property with proper landscaping, walks and comforts so that all could enjoy and partake of it.
 
FSU has proved its commitment to the Ringling Museum and the Cultural Center throughout this long transition year.  They have demonstrated that they know how to build a world class institution, a place and program that warrants the title, The State Museum of Florida, the third largest state in the union.
 
When John Ringling died in 1936 he left his estate plus a $1,300,000 endowment.  In 55 years, the year 2000, that endowment had grown to $1,800,000.  This makes the Ringling one of the poorest endowed museum's in the country and certainly the poorest of its size.  In addition, we were 78% self-supporting in comparison to 55%  for state museums of comparable size,  a starved cat, so to speak.  We now have a new, enlarged Board of Directors that is intent upon correcting that weakness.  We raised $1,3000,000 in two months last fall to match the Tibbals gift.  I believe that, if the state, by these appropriations, made each facet of this jewel sparkle, there would be support from the board and the community to enhance the endowment, to make the institution more self sufficient in the long run.
 
These appropriations are not a windfall!  They are an investment in an income producing venture.  The museum generates $22,000,000 for the state economy yearly.  Visitors come from all over the world and our message should and could with FSU's guidance go out to the world.  
 
Please support the entire museum appropriations. Create for the State of Florida a jewel to be proud of.

Subject: High School Textbook Losses


Ms. Cliett,
Now that the school year is over and my textbook reports are coming in, I want to update you on the impact of missing and lost textbooks at Escambia High School. With the seniors graduated and underclass finished with classes, our statistics are:
1. Books owed by current students: 281 @ $8,982
2. Books not turned in by students graduating or withdrawing: 592 @ $19,854

When teachers turn in missing underclass books and I check the actual rolls in late July, I expect #1 above to increase to approximately 650 books valued at $21,000 and #2 to 700 books valued at approximately $22,000.

On the bright side, we aggressively pursued students owing books and had 302 books valued at $9,399 returned. Students paid $799 for 33 lost books.

On the dim side, our losses due to withdrawing students doubled over the 1999-2000 academic year. I attribute this increase to the fact that students know there is little that can be done to them. Everyone will be helped to some degree by the provisions of Subsection (2) of Section 233.45, Florida Statues which permits principals to suspend students from extracurricular activities after exhausting all methods of recovering the book or payment.

The most disturbing outcome of this matter is the inability of our school to comply with subsection (2)(a) of Section 233.34, Florida Statues. This requires every school to purchase a textbook for every student in the core areas of English, math, science and social studies. Our textbook budget of $105,800 was approximately $75,000 under the requirement to meet the statute requirements in the new adoption areas of English grammar and ESE. As a result, I have informed my principal that we will only be able to purchase classroom sets for 9th and 10th grade classes in English Grammar and ESE and that is will put our school in violation of state statutes. From talking with other science department chairpersons, I am virtually certain that all high schools in our district are in the same dilemma. Most are not informed about the recent statute changes so are not concerned. 

Using nine years experience in tracking textbook losses, price increases and budget trends, I am confident that schools will be forced more and more toward using classroom sets vice issuing students books. The projected loss of up to $30,000 in textbook losses this year is a major contributor in our inability to provide students with the textbooks they need.

As I stated earlier, I am confident that legislation permitting schools to withhold transcripts of withdrawing and graduated students who owe for textbooks would cut this loss enormously. Our neighboring states all permit such action. I realize that this subject will certainly not be high profile but if Escambia High School is anywhere near average, the education money being lost statewide is not an insignificant amount. I continue to hope that some action can be initiated for next year's legislative session to correct the situation I have described. Thank you for listening.

Dear Govenor Bush, 

It is very important for the people of Florida that we retain the cultural 
heritages that have been left to us - preserve and protect what we have.  The 
Ringling Museum is one of those heritages that is in need of some help.  I 
urge you strongly to sign the bill that will protect this great institution 
for future generations. 

With respect,

Governor Bush:

Fifty five years ago the State of Florida accepted the Ringling Museum,
home and bay front land from the John Ringling estate.  For many years
the State of Florida has treated this valuable property like it was
mainly a Sarasota concern.

Last year the management of this Museum and property was turned over to
Florida State University which finally recognized this as a statewide
Museum.  This past season curators from many of the major museums came
to the Ringling Museum to view the Museum and give talks.  They all
praised the collection of art that is in the Museum.

Now there is a great opportunity take advantage of a wonderful grant and
finally get a world class Circus Museum, add space for education which
was one of the selling points of giving FSU control, and make some
urgent repairs including reopening the special Asolo Theatre on the
grounds..

Please sign the bill now on your desk to make a real difference for The
State of Florida's Museum by granting them the $24 million.

Thank you for your attention to this important issue.

Governors,

Wanted you to know that Friday afternoon the Escambia County Utility
Authority board held a special meeting at which they reversed their surprise
negative vote of  a week ago and endorsed the negotiated agreement with
International Paper, as facilitated by DEP.  .

Our plan will make this the first bleached kraft paper mill in America to
completely eliminate all direct discharges into surface water.
Five million gallons of water will be save everyday because the plant will
put to benefiicial use the recycled wastewater from the sewage treatment
plant.
Water infrastructure will be built and sized for projected growth in this
area, promoting "smart growth" and getting rid of leaking septic systems.

Sorry we hit this unexpected speed bump.  All is now right with this project.

Subject: Lionel Tate



	I have reviewed the petition for clemency submitted by Lionel Tate's
lawyer.  We are in the process of reviewing all the accompanying documents.
In brief, the petition argues that Tate is a disadvantaged, immature child,
who caused harm without really meaning to, and who should be rehabilitated
and not punished.

	Following are some key points made in the petition by Tate's lawyer:

	"While we will be advocating a full pardon for Lionel, please do not
misunderstand our most pressing goal:  to move him immediately to a facility
in which he will suffer no further mental, emotional, or physical harm."
(p. 3)

	"We further request that this matter be set for hearing as soon as
possible in light of the criminalizing effect this facility [i.e., the DJJ
facility] is having on Lionel each day we wait."  (p. 4)

	"We urge Lionel Tate's immediate transfer to the Level VI juvenile
facility at Bay Point School in Miami, Florida."  (p. 23)  [You are on the
advisory board of this school.]

	


	The information you requested regarding Tate's conduct while he has
been in custody is being compiled and should be available on Monday.

	This is accompanied by a draft statement responding to Tate's
clemency request.  

	I will be available to discuss this over the weekend if you would
like.  My home phone number is (850) 383-6805.  My cell phone is (850)

STORYTELLING IS 'NEW' AGAIN: 
KEY TO EFFECTIVE LITERACY PROGRAMS 
        TALLAHASSEE, Fla.-A recent survey of successful family literacy programs across the United States revealed that each included storytelling as a vital component, according to Florida State University Professor Barbara C. Palmer. 
        "Storytelling has been accepted as an educational tool throughout the ages," Palmer said. "People around the world have always told stories as a way of passing down their history, beliefs and traditions. Long before history was recorded, storytelling served civilizations to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next. Today storytelling can be used to continue these traditional purposes as well as to promote language and literacy development within families." 
        The results of her research appear in the article, "The Role of Storytelling in Effective Family Literacy Programs," which was recently published in Reading Horizons, a professional journal. 
        "The educational benefits of storytelling are impressive, particularly when one considers Florida's and the nation's diverse population, since storytelling can be used flexibly with students from diverse cultural and language backgrounds," Palmer said. "With the integration of today's technology and storytelling, something that is very old has once again become new." 
        Palmer's research grows out of the family literacy movement, using the concept of the family-as-educator, most notably advocated by former First Lady Barbara Bush's adult literacy campaign and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's Family Literacy Initiative for Florida. 
        Family literacy programs recognize that children influence parents just 
as much as parents and other significant adults influence children. Adult literacy programs aim to teach adults how to read so that they can help the schools teach 
their children to read by stimulating the intellectual environment at home. After sampling effective family literacy programs, Palmer said the common thread of storytelling as a key component gave further support to using this empowering tool to 
build meaningful educational systems for today's lifelong learners. 
        "Storytelling and story writing are excellent vehicles for integrating the language processes of listening, speaking, reading and writing," Palmer said. "The storytelling process can be used for developing higher order thinking as well as inspiring story creativity. Furthermore, it allows opportunities for students to interact within a rich multicultural context, thus promoting respect for diversity."    
        One such successful literacy program is The Parents Power Works Program in Palm Beach County, Fla. This program grew out of the awareness that children need support from home in order to improve their literacy skills. Since 1993, this model program has provided adult education classes, time for parents and children to learn together, and opportunities for parents to volunteer at their children's schools. The program has used storytelling as a component of community field trips and participants who are particularly skilled in storytelling have been encouraged to visit different classrooms. The program operates in two schools and involves African Americans and Hispanics. 
        Other successful programs highlighted in Palmer's article were the Club Familiar de Narracion de Cuentos in Washington, D.C.; the Navajo Parent/Child Reading Program on the Navajo Reservation in Ariz.; the Reading is Fundamental/KHDC-FM partnership in Salinas Valley, Cal.; and the Tellin' Stories Project in the District of Columbia area. 
        Palmer, an FSU professor of Reading and Language Arts Education in the Department of Educational Theory and Practice, has spoken frequently on "Language and Literacy Development through Storytelling" at regional, national and international conferences. In 1994, she received the University Teaching Award for Recognition of Excellence. She has written numerous articles, short stories, and several books, including "Reading By Doing: An Introduction to Effective Reading" and "Developing Cultural Literacy Through the Writing Process."

Governor 

Great job tonight on the show. It is amazing how much you and I are on the 
same wavelength on education issues. I know you have big decisions to make 
regarding the SBE but I wanted to put in one last plug for me. 

I bring a unique set of experiences to the table and the ability to hit the 
ground running. I am greatly concerned that the new board not spend too long 
on organizational issues and not have a steep learning curve as there is so 
much to accomplish. We need to move swiftly to the meatier issues of 
accountability and performance, replication of success and remediation of 
failure and system integration. Opponents of reorg. would love to have this 
get bogged down in reorganization related bureaucratic issues and we need to 
make sure this does not happen. I can help this be a success. I have 
experienced it first hand. 

On a related issue, I spoke yesterday in Madison County to the Rotary. The 
questions asked at the end, as well as after conversations lead me to believe 
these good folks need some additional explaining about many of the positive 
initiatives in government under your leadership. They seemed to be buying the 
Tall. Dem. view of the world. I do not know how best to do this, (I tried 
from an objective point of view), but if other rural counties reflect these 
same confusions it may require a bit of political remediation by other 
friends and associates. These are folks that should be on the same side 
philosophically. 

I remain available to discuss the SBE situation with you anytime. I know you 
would be well served by my appointment. Thanks for your consideration and 
friendship.

Dear Governor Bush:

In a briefing from our Florida offices, I was pleased to learn that just
compensation legislation passed by an overwhelming majority in the House and
Senate and the Transportation Bill is now on its way to your desk for your
signature. As you know, the Florida outdoor advertising industry has worked
for three years on passing this important property rights legislation.  

Through a friendship with your Father and as chairman for your brother's
campaign in the great state of Arizona, I have always felt that your family
was strong on protecting the property rights of all Americans.  In industry
meetings with Lt. Governor Frank Brogan and in a meeting with Mark Mays, COO
of Clear Channel, my understanding is that both you and the Lt. Governor
indicated your support of this important issue.  

Governor, in my 50 years of working in the outdoor advertising business, our
industry has never encountered the battles to protect our property that we
have in Florida in the last twenty years.  I cannot begin to tell you what
we have spent on legal bills in Florida, but it is in the millions of
dollars.  We need this legislation to maintain our assets.  We are only
asking to protect what was legally and lawfully constructed in your state.

We have heard that you have concerns that the Transportation Bill became a
"train."  Please, we implore you, do not send a message on "trains" by
vetoing this bill.  Our legislation was heard in eight separate committee
hearings, and four sessions of the full House and Senate.  My understanding
is that the late amendments to the transportation bill contain no
substantive controversial provisions.

The affect of a veto would cause irreparable damage to our company.  Eller
employees approximately 300 people in Florida and has annual sales over One
Hundred Million Dollars.  I am strongly urging your support of our viable
business by asking you to sign the Transportation Bill, CS/CS/3rdEng/H 1053.

Thank you for your consideration.

not fair to fl. owners in flood zones.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Governor Bush (Jeb):
    Please veto the proposed $20 million transfer of mney in the state budget  from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe fund to finance flood control projects  in Southeast Florida.  While these projects may be needed, the anticipated  use of this money sets a bad precedent and will further raise windstorm  insurance rates throughout the state.
    According to the Florida Department of Insurance, the average rate of  increase for Floridians due to this budget item will be over 4 percent.   However, due to local factors such as risk and location, the rate increase  could be as high as 47.3%.  In another example, some homes Miami-Dade County  could see a further $108 yearly rise in already soaring insurance premiums.   Please help put a stop to these increases.
    I understand that insurance is another cost of doing business.  In  Florida, however, windstorm rates continue to climb and threaten to put  homeownership out of reach.  Again, I encourage you to do all you can to keep  premiums down.  Please veto this budget item.
 do not increase   insurance rates.  I know  you believe in diversity and equal opportunity and fulfilling the American  Dream of home ownership.
    Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns on this matter.
i  am a sr. citizen on a fixed income  and in a flood zone also.
Sincerely,

Subject: High School Textbook Losses


Ms. Cliett,
Now that the school year is over and my textbook reports are coming in, I want to update you on the impact of missing and lost textbooks at Escambia High School. With the seniors graduated and underclass finished with classes, our statistics are:
1. Books owed by current students: 281 @ $8,982
2. Books not turned in by students graduating or withdrawing: 592 @ $19,854

When teachers turn in missing underclass books and I check the actual rolls in late July, I expect #1 above to increase to approximately 650 books valued at $21,000 and #2 to 700 books valued at approximately $22,000.

On the bright side, we aggressively pursued students owing books and had 302 books valued at $9,399 returned. Students paid $799 for 33 lost books.

On the dim side, our losses due to withdrawing students doubled over the 1999-2000 academic year. I attribute this increase to the fact that students know there is little that can be done to them. Everyone will be helped to some degree by the provisions of Subsection (2) of Section 233.45, Florida Statues which permits principals to suspend students from extracurricular activities after exhausting all methods of recovering the book or payment.

The most disturbing outcome of this matter is the inability of our school to comply with subsection (2)(a) of Section 233.34, Florida Statues. This requires every school to purchase a textbook for every student in the core areas of English, math, science and social studies. Our textbook budget of $105,800 was approximately $75,000 under the requirement to meet the statute requirements in the new adoption areas of English grammar and ESE. As a result, I have informed my principal that we will only be able to purchase classroom sets for 9th and 10th grade classes in English Grammar and ESE and that is will put our school in violation of state statutes. From talking with other science department chairpersons, I am virtually certain that all high schools in our district are in the same dilemma. Most are not informed about the recent statute changes so are not concerned. 

Using nine years experience in tracking textbook losses, price increases and budget trends, I am confident that schools will be forced more and more toward using classroom sets vice issuing students books. The projected loss of up to $30,000 in textbook losses this year is a major contributor in our inability to provide students with the textbooks they need.

As I stated earlier, I am confident that legislation permitting schools to withhold transcripts of withdrawing and graduated students who owe for textbooks would cut this loss enormously. Our neighboring states all permit such action. I realize that this subject will certainly not be high profile but if Escambia High School is anywhere near average, the education money being lost statewide is not an insignificant amount. I continue to hope that some action can be initiated for next year's legislative session to correct the situation I have described. Thank you for listening.

Dear Governor Bush:  May I please ask for your consideration of KATHERINE 
BECK  and TRAVIS POTTER to fill the position vacated by Leon County 
Commissioner Rudy Maloy.   

Beginning with Kathie Beck:  Ms. Beck is a registered Republican, who ran in 
our last local county commission race, District 4.  Though she did not 
prevail, she was close.  Kathie demonstrated such a strong ability to be a 
respected leader within the Republican Party, that she also earned support of 
Democrats and Independents alike.   She was able to garner support because of 
her strengths rather than which party she belongs to.   

Ms. Beck is absolutely brilliant in her ability to grasp the big picture of 
situations. She is quick to learn and fair in her decision making.  She is 
outstanding in her communication skills and would be a great asset to the 
Leon County Commission--one that is desperately needed.  As important--she 
already has insight and experience pertaining to the workings of local 
government and would not need much time to be "brought up to speed". 

Regarding Travis Potter:  While I do not know Travis as well as Kathie Beck, 
I am very impressed with his personal commitment to guide the city of 
Tallahassee and Leon County.  Though Travis does not have the experience that 
Ms. Beck has, I do believe he would be extremely committed to learn and to 
perform in a professional manner.   He demonstrates the skills necessary to 
come on Board the Leon County Commission.  Therefore, I ask that you consider 
Travis in the event Ms. Beck is not considered as your first choice.   

Very sincerely,                              Stella Furjanic

RE: VETO of HB 1157

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am writing to you today as Chief Executive Officer of American Lawyer Media, Inc., to strongly urge your veto of HB 1157 which was recently passed by the Florida legislature.   As you may know, ALM is a leading integrated media company. ALM currently owns and publishes 25 national and regional legal magazines and newspapers, including The American Lawyer and The National Law Journal.  Three of our largest publications, the Miami Daily Business Review, the Broward Daily Business Review and the Palm Beach Daily Business Review, are based in Florida. 

We are concerned about HB 1157 because the legislation eliminates the requirement that fictitious names be published in local newspapers, and instead substitutes on line posting by the Department of State on its web site. As I’m sure you are aware, the purpose of publication is to inform Florida residents, in their local newspapers, what entities are doing business in their localities under an assumed name. 

Specifically, we are concerned about the precedent set in this bill with respect to the public’s right to know. We support the use of the internet as a supplement to printed notice, but not in lieu of such notice.  People go to their newspapers to find community news of local interest. These local newspapers provide a permanent, historical record that cannot be altered. For these reasons, it is essential that they continue to provide independent, geographically relevant public notice content.  

Furthermore, by moving these notices to a web only environment, the proposed law deprives many local businesses of the opportunity for tracking business leads and other business opportunities.  Perhaps equally important, these notices are an inexpensive (generally $25-$50 one time payment), cost effective way for a new business to advertise.  While the overall cost is very small for any individual business, the cumulative effect of a loss of these notices on the publishing industry would be dramatic.  

Newspapers have played a pivotal role in our nation since its inception. Our citizens read newspapers for more than just the headlines. Newspapers provide vital information in a variety of forms including public notice information. We recognize that the internet is an exciting new medium with extraordinary potential.  However, we contend that it should not be the sole means for the dissemination of local information such as public notices. 

Again, we urge you to consider a veto of HB 1157.  Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.

A huge Thank you from a family who cares.  :o)
 
Redirect the people who wanted SB1018 to use the funds in a different manner for the same end result in a more family friendly manner. I believe educating parents on multiple techniques for additional options they have in parenting would be a start. Getting to the people through media avenues parents use every day;  TV & radio commercials, newspapers, work place trainings, churches, billboards and other media outlets you can lesson the abuse neglect and extortion rate by sharing information. Educating all people on what abuse, neglect and extortion actually is will lesson unnecessary calls. Offer options when parents are in crisis not criticism. Most parents who abuse do so for lack of resources not to hurt their child. We unfortunately have sick people in the world in which we live where no rehab will cure their sick minds for these situations I have no answers. The larger percentage of abuse and neglect I believe comes from lack of options/alternatives at the time of need. EDUCATE ALL PEOPLE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT where they are more apt to listen!

Gov. Bush,
Will I am sure there is a third best choice, I am certain that SB 10 and HB
287 will do more harm than good and return are emergency response system to
a previously bad situation. Shortly before I opened my practice here in
Volusia County in 1979, the emergency care and transport of injured people
was disastrous and dangerous. The local doctors and specifically Dr Tom
Scott, a now deceased neurosurgeon, recognized the need for county wide
emergency response and transport of injured people. As a result EVAC was
founded and we have been blessed with excellent coverage. Now the multiple
municipalities each want to have their own firemen able to respond and
transport. There will not be universal county wide coverage and people will
be injured by the lack of county wide response. In the future county wide
consolidation of all fire, police, evac etc. should take place and then
probably there should be evac stationed at each fire house and or police
station and where else indicated. Until then to dismantle EVAC and allow the
local fire departments to respond and transport will be a dangerous and
regressive step. Please veto SB 10 and HB287.
Thank you for signing the recent all products legislation. It certainly was
the right thing to do.
As always your friend and supporter,
Rick Lentz

(Todd Pressman) Governor, this industry desperately needs your support of 
this bill.  If not passed, City's and County's will pass new bans and new 
amortization ordinances throughout the State.  In one municipality, one 
company has spent $400,000 in the last year alone defending their property 
rights. 
    The bill was heard in 8 separate committee hearings and during 4 
sessions of the full House and Senate.   
    The industry has worked hard and made severe compromises to reach the 
goals the administration, initially thru Sally Bradshaw, wanted to see in 
order to balance this issue out.  It includes great interest from the 
agricultural community.  This is a property rights issue and deserves your 
support. 
    The effect of a veto will cause irreconcilable damage to a legal and 
lawful industry.                                                  
    We would like an opportunity to meet with you again on this issue if it

I am qualified and committed to running hard again when the seat
approaches another election. I would be honored to have your

Since my phone has been ringing off the hook on this issue this morning I know that you are really getting lobbied.  I will be very short and direct.  This commission needs more strong leadership, not simply a seat filled. People who will challenge the system ( like yourself) and take the heat for doing it.  I have spoken with Tony Grippa this morning and I am aware of his opinions.  I have also spoken with strong business leaders with progressive attitudes and here are the names we would like you to consider.
 
In no particular order:
 
Will Messer: he ran against Tony Grippa and is a bright young face in the Republican Party. His father is Elliott Messer, a long time well respected attorney.
 
Kim Williams: He is the owner of a local business , Marpan Supply, and is extremely well respected by the small business community including the minority community.  He leads the chamber effort in working with local businesses. He is a Democrat but supported you in both elections.
 
Jim Hunt: Jim is a Republican and the owner of a local technology company. He is very involved in the Economic Development movement and is on the chamber board.
 
The name of Ed Dupey has come up in conversations.  He has not been very active in the business community but in talking with several people he is well respected and certainly would be very acceptable to us.
 
Good Luck and again Thank You

Good afternoon, 

I again want to thank you for coming to the Family CAFE and being so warm and 
open with families.  I enjoyed helping you work the crowd.  People sure 
appreciate all you've done to help improve the lives of both persons with 
disabilities and their families. 

Last week I had lunch with J. R.  Harding and in the course of our discussion 
he told me of his keen desire in being appointed as one of the new Trustees 
to Florida State University.  Furthermore, he made me really think about the 
importance of disability representation on all the Trustee boards for all 
universities. 

After listening to all of J.R.'s experience as a former Board of Regents 
student representative and his doctorate in educational systems of higher 
education I think he makes a very strong candidate for consideration. 

I would like to formally recommend J.R. Harding for your consideration. 

As you've seen, the passion and involvement of both advocates for and persons 
with disabilities can be a powerful and very often positive influence in 
improving the way government operates.  Please consider this opportunity to 
continue your leadership in improving the options and opportunities for 
persons with disabilities, their families, and our great state. 

Thanks again for your true passion and love of people.  You are making a 
difference!   

Have a great weekend.

Governor:  I checked with FSU to get answers to your questions and I learned the following. 

The latest plan is to admit 50 students per year for a total of 150 (the previous number was 500) and to offer the program at the Panama City Campus in conjunction with Gulf Coast Community College.  Given this new plan, annual operating costs to be paid out of general revenue are $4.6 M, plus $.9 M for clinic training after the third year, for total annual operating costs when the program is fully operational of $5.5 M.  Construction costs are $20 M for a joint use laboratory building.

I have the detailed information if you would like it.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Your support for the school of chiropractic medicine at the FSU Panama City 
campus is strongly urged. As a second generation alumnus, it will make me 
proud for my alma mater to offer the best chiropractic medicine education 
anywhere. The people of Florida will be the winners, especially minorities 
and seniors when the school and its research facilities are fully 
operational.They will benefit from the research results flowing from the 
school working in tandem with the fully funded endowed Chair in Chiropractic 
and Biomedical Mechanics Research. 

It is important to emphasize that the school project has been through every 
required review and study, including the Board of Regents the Postsecondary 
Education Planning Commission, leading to an exhaustive implementation play 
by M.G.T. 

Floridians deserve the opportunity to study chiropractic medicine in their 
home state at a state university and apply their first class education to 
their fellow Floridians. Minority students who have difficulty in meeting 
tuition and costs of private, out of state chiropractic schools will benefit 
from attending a state university at much more affordable costs. 

As President of the National Association of Chiropractic Attorneys (which 
provides the opportunity to broadly observe chiropractic on a nationwide 
basis), I am constantly reminded that Florida lacks adequate representation 
in the chiropractic profession among the black and Latin communities. Perhaps 
my sensitivity to this observation is emphasized 
because I am Puerto Rican. But, the fact remains that there are fewer than 
10 black and 50 Latin chiropractors in Florida. 

Utilization of the Panama City campus will provide educational as well as 
economic opportunities to West Florida and provide a wise use of the FSU 
facilities in conjunction with the Gulf Coast Community College. An 
additional benefit can come from establishing a two year chiropractic 
assistant program at the community college and share the facilities of both 
campuses. 

In short, the chiropractic college is a winner for FSU, Gulf Coast Community 
College, Panama City, West Florida, Floridians who want to obtain their 
education in Florida at the best school of chiropractic medicine and 
Floridians benefiting from the applied research. 

Please support the start up appropriations in the Appropriations Bill. Thank 
you.

Governor:  My good friend Michael Friedman asked to send you this e-mail in support of Adriana Macretti.  You may also respond to him at my address.
 
Dear Governor:
 
This could be the strangest e-mail you will recieve, so please read with care.  Why would a liberal Democrat be writing to a Republican governor to request his consideration on any issue?  But when all is said and done, we might disagree on approaches to different issues, but we both passionately believe that public education is the only hope for the future of our state, our community and our country.  I am extremely distressed at the situation confronting the Miami-Dade County Public Schools.  When the public becomes allienated, disenchanted and cynical about our public education system, concern rapidly degenerates to crisis.  As I spend time in my former legislative district of Northeast Dade, where the people would rather amputate their right arm than to not support public education, the degree and the depth of  their unhappiness about the public school system must be immediately addressed and appropriately corrected.
 
I have, over the last seven years, had the opportunity and the unique pleasure of working with one conservative Republican, Adriana Macretti.  Now I am not planning on changing my voter registration, so stop any palpitations.  The Republican Party would never be able to explain me as a member of your tribe (as sometimes the Democratic Party has equal trouble.)  But my work with Adriana as Executive Director of Kids Voting, as a member of the Alliance for Aging and the Human Services Coaltion, has demonstrated to me that she is a person of the highest ethical principles of anyone that I have ever known in my public career.  Her ability to consider issues and make decisions based on the best interest of people, whether they be children or senior citizens, is something that needs to be emulated many times over by public officials.  Adriana serves as a role model and an inspiration to people who have cynically written off the public school system's capacity to deliver high quality, high standards, and ethical decision making.  I believe at this time this community needs someone of the caliber and the quality and the commitment that Adriana would bring to the Miami-Dade County Public School System.  I therefore request that you give due consideration to the appointment of Adriana Comellas-Macretti to fill the interim position on the Miami-Dade County School Board, so that her leadership will be able to pull us back from the edge and lead us to a better tomorrow.  If it would help, I would not be offended if you chose not to share this note with anyone, for I wish not to do anything that might cause you not to appoint Adriana.  Knowing and expecting you will do what is right for the kids and your home community, I am respectfully, Michael Friedman, former Representative, Miami-Dade County.  If I can be of any help, please call me at 305-371-7410, or you can e-mail me at Anne Thompson's address, annerjt@hotmail.com

Jeb, should you seek re-election, you'll be swept into office as if caught

Greatly improved redfish stocks will have a huge socio-economic impact on

Got a call from the press about "Fire Tower" issue. Was able to use the

	I have reviewed the petition for clemency submitted by Lionel Tate's
lawyer.  We are in the process of reviewing all the accompanying documents.
In brief, the petition argues that Tate is a disadvantaged, immature child,
who caused harm without really meaning to, and who should be rehabilitated
and not punished.

	Following are some key points made in the petition by Tate's lawyer:

	"While we will be advocating a full pardon for Lionel, please do not
misunderstand our most pressing goal:  to move him immediately to a facility
in which he will suffer no further mental, emotional, or physical harm."
(p. 3)

	"We further request that this matter be set for hearing as soon as
possible in light of the criminalizing effect this facility [i.e., the DJJ
facility] is having on Lionel each day we wait."  (p. 4)

	"We urge Lionel Tate's immediate transfer to the Level VI juvenile
facility at Bay Point School in Miami, Florida."  (p. 23)  [You are on the
advisory board of this school.]

	


	The information you requested regarding Tate's conduct while he has
been in custody is being compiled and should be available on Monday.

	This is accompanied by a draft statement responding to Tate's
clemency request.  

	I will be available to discuss this over the weekend if you would
like.  My home phone number is (850) 383-6805.  My cell phone is (850)
510-9490.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I apologize, I didn't mean to say cost neutral, what I was trying to say was that if you had 500 new students entering into any of FSU's post-graduate programs there would be a cost to the State (because the total cost per student is determined via the appropriations process).  According to the MGT study there would be no difference cost wise to the State if these students were entering into any post-graduate program or chiropractic college, they would just be considered 500 new students. I hope this clears up my intent.  Thank you for your consideration.
 
Have a great weekend.

Subject: FSU College of Chiropractic



Jeb, 
  
Thank you for taking the time to talk with me regarding the FSU College of Chiropractic last week.  Given the significant dollars that are being spent for the medical school, I share your concerns regarding the long term costs.  Here are the facts that you requested.

  
Based on data from FSU and the MGT report the total capital costs would be around $20 million.  Because of the  currently available and underutilized classroom space at FSU Panama City and Gulfcoast Community College, the capital outlay could be budgeted over a 3-4 year time span. According to the plan for FSU Panama City, these would be joint use facilities, including labs, a library, and a clinic. There has been talk about adding other health related programs (acupuncture, nutrition, massage therapy) which could utilize the same capital costs. 

  
According to the MGT study, approximately 700 Florida students matriculate annually at chiropractic schools across the country.  Many go to Life University in Atlanta, GA.  The program, while in close proximity to our state, has a longer program than other chiropractic schools (4 1/2 years vs. 4 years) but has the highest failure rate for the Florida Boards.  This program is also more costly than the other programs.  Florida, while ranked 3rd nationally in population, is the largest state without a chiropractic school (Texas has 2, California 5 and New York 1). 

  
The MGT report shows the average cost of private medical and chiropractic education to be around $120,000, vs. $55,000 in a public setting.  Several chiropractic school presidents have stated that this is one major reason why there is little ethnic diversity in chiropractic (5%). 

  
The legislature funded an implementation plan in 2000  that showed the need and validity of a publicly funded chiropractic school in Florida.  The profession is growing, there are more patients utilizing non surgical, drugless methods of health care ($13 billion spent by patients in 1998); there is a need for more practitioners in the chiropractic profession, given our population growth, our aging population, and the high costs of medical care, including drug and institutional costs.  This extensive study by MGT laid out a long range plan, unlike the medical school that was put into place over the objections of the BOR.

  
FSU would benefit with a new source of research dollars. The National Institute of Health has a $90 million grant program for alternative health care for this year. Given FSU's Research 1 accreditation, it could qualify for millions of dollars to fund various programs.  

  
The annual cost of $7-$8 million for the projected 500 students is the same amount of money spent if these were students entering any other FSU graduate program, therefore being budget neutral.  Many of us feel that our state has a responsibility educating our students rather than expecting other states to bear the cost. 

  
The local economic impact to the Panama City area would be tremendous.  The last private chiropractic school to open (Parker College in Fort Worth, Texas) has an annual fiscal impact of $25 million.

  
In summary Governor, I honestly do not see a downside for this program.   A health care program that the State of Florida will monitor and customize, teaching a more diverse group of physicians  due to lower costs to treat a growing and aging, more ethnically diverse population, utilizing a campus that is underused in an area that would greatly benefit economically.  Health care will soon be a top priority to all Floridians;  having the first publicly funded chiropractic program right here in our state would send a powerful message.  

Governor, please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you for your time.

Regarding budget cuts for Vocational Education, either the money is beign

for equipment going on two years now.
Again your support on this issue is appreciated and welcomed by all

The last time I had the opportunity to speak to you about the Ringling Museum was at the museum's year 2000 Governor's Ball. Thank you for allowing the museum to be part of Florida State University. Having been on the museum board for the past four years, I was astonished to witness the improvements we were able to make in the past year under FSU's guidance. As you review the state's proposed new budget, I respectfully request that you recognize the appropriations the Legislature provided for new and renovated facilities at the Ringling Museum. The needs there are great-ranging from life/safety issues, to access for persons with disabilities, to opportunities for scholarship and research. Thank you again for all you have done for our State Museum.

Dear governor Bush: I am writing to solicit your approval of several
items in the budget that will dramatically impact the Sarasota area as
well as the 18 county catchment area involved in the closure of G Pierce
Wood.
Specifically:
	I seek your approval for full funding as recommend by the Legislature
for the community based programs that will be needed by DCF to provide
for those no longer going to GPW.
	Additionally I ask your support for those member projects in both
Manatee and Sarasota Counties that provide 24/7 walk in services for
mental health and substance abuse called the Family Emergency Treatment
Center {FETC}.
	Support is asked for Level 2 housing for Desoto,Manatee and Sarasota
counties which provides 24/7 supervised living for persons with sever
and persistent mental illness. This funding not only accommodates
patients from GPW but also those who will no longer be going there and
also those who in the past would have never been admitted there.
	A real gap has occurred in Sarasota County in the provision of
substance abuse inpatient treatment but through your approval of funding
for the Adolescent Residential Treatment Center this gap will be closed
for the first time. This also will be a huge spoke in the wheel of our
communities overall efforts to prevent our youth from entering into or
deeper into the system. It also will supplement our Juvenile Assessment
Centers effort, which have been hampered to this point by the lack of
treatment for inpatients. This in turn keeps juveniles out of DJJ beds.
	That brings me to my final request for support of the Sarasota Juvenile
Assessment Center. Your support will insure that DJJ's reorganization in
our area will meet yours and Secretary Bankhead's goals. DJJ has told us
that if the 210,000 is approved it will allow our JAC to improve to the
level of being able to do Detention Screening. Local dollars and support
will then be able to be utilized for physcosocial assessment and
referral. This will also provide a link to the CAIC program which is a 4
agency multi- county grant program dealing with the front door element
of at risk youth. Thus with all these elements our community will be
able to provide the most cost effective and highest level of services
both front and back door for our at-risk youth.
Let me thank you in advance for what I hope is favorable consideration
of these budget issues

Council,Chair Circuit 12 Juvenile Justice Board, and OJJDP-DJJ SAG

Dear Governor Bush:
 
   I do not know you personally Governor, but I know your family and I particularly feel close to your Mom and Dad.  I had great respect for both of them as they stood for the same values that I did.  I voted for your Dad twice, your brother once and you once based on my respect for your family and its heritage.  The billboard provisions encrypted into the legislation that is before you for review should not even be there for the following reasons:
 
1. Bills that come to your desk that contain provisions that have been smuggled into the language to thwart detection in a complex piece of legislation are no different in
my mind than a piece of mail or package that contains illegal drugs, but is labeled as a wedding gift.  It is a deceit; an attempt by unscrupulous peddlers to profit from 
deception because they already know that the public back home and their elected officials not only do not like or want their wares, but have passed ordinances to control their design, limit their proliferation, and reduce their numbers.  The legislature has failed us in this session and we must rely on the Bush integrity to deny this smuggling operation and so instruct the house and senate that this type of manipulation will not be sanctioned by your administration.
 
2. Language in bills before the Governor of Florida that have been hawked by lobbyists in Tallahassee in private because the very same arguments and desires have been
debated, routed and refused in hundreds of citizen committee meetings, official government workshops, city council meetings and county commission meetings in 67 counties and many of the over 450 municipalities in the state should not be acknowledged into law in Tallahassee when they have already been rejected across the width and breadth of our great state.  To deny the constitutional and statutory delegations of home rule so fundamental to our republic and to the republican party will continue to polarize the electorate against centralized government and will work to nullify your attempts at unification and reform.
 
3. The Department of Transportation is an executive agency of the State and its Secretary should not allow the billboard industry or any other special interest group privileged access to the senior staff so that they can craft language fulfilling their specific commercial interests into proposed legislation that contains language that is critical to the management and operation of the agency.  To do so denies the public trust by purposely creating the situation in the house, the senate, and ultimately, in the Governor's office, of having to make the decision of whether to throw the baby out with the bath water.
 
   Citizens today ache for justice, for fairness, for common sense, and for integrity.  We try to send statesmanship to Tallahassee to represent these qualities.  We saw these qualities in you.  Please show us your strength of character and do not reward the billboard industry at the expense of a scenic Florida, at the expense of our diligent efforts to legislate ordinances to regulate billboards, at the expense of our county pocketbooks, and at the expense of our faith in representative government and home rule.
 
We greatly appreciate a Governor who gives us the opportunity to speak directly to his office through the marvelous technology of Email.  Thanks for listening and I send my best regards to your family.
 
Respectfully yours,

Dear Governor Bush,
My understanding is that you will be considering SB 1020 tomorrow.  This
bill would allow a county to charge only those residences and businesses
that demand Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for the cost of that service.
Vetoing this bill will result in counties facing the choice of abandoning
EMS or  funding it through a new tax imposed on all property.  We really
need your support and help on this critical issue for our communities.  I
respectfully request your help in ensuring passage of this important
legislation.  Our interest is to ensure that all Floridians receive quality
EMS services throughout the state.  Thanks.

Jeb, should you seek re-election, you'll be swept into office as if caught 
in an avalanche if you approve funding for the redfish hatchery. It 
desperately needs to be moved ahead to follow  the phenomenal success trail 
blazed by Texas. 

Greatly improved redfish stocks will have a huge socio-economic impact on 
Florida, for the general public as well as for anglers. 

To veto this crucial money would be double-faulting on match point. 

All the best, Karl

Dear Governer Bush,

I ask not only for myself, but also in behalf of the Pinellas County 
Chiropractic Society, that you support the chiropractic program at FSU.

I will not reiterate the reasons for this request as you have had them 
presented to you on numerous occassions.

I would like to share a recent experience though. As president of the PCCS, I 
often receive requests for referrals. A gentleman called on behalf of his 
daughter who was preparing a school project, he asked for the name of a black 
DC in the county so his daughter might interview him. I could not think of one 
and informed the gentleman that I would get back with him. After numerous phone 
calls attempting to locate a black DC I returned a call to the gentleman and 
informed him that not only were their no black DC's in Pinellas County, their 
were none in Pasco, Hillsborough, Hernando, Sarasota and Manatee Counties as 
well.

This experience was honestly quite astonishing to me. Their are approximately 
350 DC's in Pinellas County alone!

The minority opportunity is but one of many reasons why we need the FSU 
Chiropractic program but as stated above I will not reiterate at this time.

I thank you very much for your time and if I can ever be of assistance to you 
in any way please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Dr. Ken Peluso
President, Pinellas County Chiropractic Society

Governor:  My good friend Michael Friedman asked to send you this e-mail in support of Adriana Macretti.  You may also respond to him at my address.
 
Dear Governor:
 
This could be the strangest e-mail you will recieve, so please read with care.  Why would a liberal Democrat be writing to a Republican governor to request his consideration on any issue?  But when all is said and done, we might disagree on approaches to different issues, but we both passionately believe that public education is the only hope for the future of our state, our community and our country.  I am extremely distressed at the situation confronting the Miami-Dade County Public Schools.  When the public becomes allienated, disenchanted and cynical about our public education system, concern rapidly degenerates to crisis.  As I spend time in my former legislative district of Northeast Dade, where the people would rather amputate their right arm than to not support public education, the degree and the depth of  their unhappiness about the public school system must be immediately addressed and appropriately corrected.
 
I have, over the last seven years, had the opportunity and the unique pleasure of working with one conservative Republican, Adriana Macretti.  Now I am not planning on changing my voter registration, so stop any palpitations.  The Republican Party would never be able to explain me as a member of your tribe (as sometimes the Democratic Party has equal trouble.)  But my work with Adriana as Executive Director of Kids Voting, as a member of the Alliance for Aging and the Human Services Coaltion, has demonstrated to me that she is a person of the highest ethical principles of anyone that I have ever known in my public career.  Her ability to consider issues and make decisions based on the best interest of people, whether they be children or senior citizens, is something that needs to be emulated many times over by public officials.  Adriana serves as a role model and an inspiration to people who have cynically written off the public school system's capacity to deliver high quality, high standards, and ethical decision making.  I believe at this time this community needs someone of the caliber and the quality and the commitment that Adriana would bring to the Miami-Dade County Public School System.  I therefore request that you give due consideration to the appointment of Adriana Comellas-Macretti to fill the interim position on the Miami-Dade County School Board, so that her leadership will be able to pull us back from the edge and lead us to a better tomorrow.  If it would help, I would not be offended if you chose not to share this note with anyone, for I wish not to do anything that might cause you not to appoint Adriana.  Knowing and expecting you will do what is right for the kids and your home community, I am respectfully, Michael Friedman, former Representative, Miami-Dade County.  If I can be of any help, please call me at 305-371-7410, or you can e-mail me at Anne Thompson's address, annerjt@hotmail.com

Governor:  I checked with FSU to get answers to your questions and I learned the following. 

The latest plan is to admit 50 students per year for a total of 150 (the previous number was 500) and to offer the program at the Panama City Campus in conjunction with Gulf Coast Community College.  Given this new plan, annual operating costs to be paid out of general revenue are $4.6 M, plus $.9 M for clinic training after the third year, for total annual operating costs when the program is fully operational of $5.5 M.  Construction costs are $20 M for a joint use laboratory building.

I have the detailed information if you would like it.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Your support for the school of chiropractic medicine at the FSU Panama City 
campus is strongly urged. As a second generation alumnus, it will make me 
proud for my alma mater to offer the best chiropractic medicine education 
anywhere. The people of Florida will be the winners, especially minorities 
and seniors when the school and its research facilities are fully 
operational.They will benefit from the research results flowing from the 
school working in tandem with the fully funded endowed Chair in Chiropractic 
and Biomedical Mechanics Research. 

It is important to emphasize that the school project has been through every 
required review and study, including the Board of Regents the Postsecondary 
Education Planning Commission, leading to an exhaustive implementation play 
by M.G.T. 

Floridians deserve the opportunity to study chiropractic medicine in their 
home state at a state university and apply their first class education to 
their fellow Floridians. Minority students who have difficulty in meeting 
tuition and costs of private, out of state chiropractic schools will benefit 
from attending a state university at much more affordable costs. 

As President of the National Association of Chiropractic Attorneys (which 
provides the opportunity to broadly observe chiropractic on a nationwide 
basis), I am constantly reminded that Florida lacks adequate representation 
in the chiropractic profession among the black and Latin communities. Perhaps 
my sensitivity to this observation is emphasized 
because I am Puerto Rican. But, the fact remains that there are fewer than 
10 black and 50 Latin chiropractors in Florida. 

Utilization of the Panama City campus will provide educational as well as 
economic opportunities to West Florida and provide a wise use of the FSU 
facilities in conjunction with the Gulf Coast Community College. An 
additional benefit can come from establishing a two year chiropractic 
assistant program at the community college and share the facilities of both 
campuses. 

In short, the chiropractic college is a winner for FSU, Gulf Coast Community 
College, Panama City, West Florida, Floridians who want to obtain their 
education in Florida at the best school of chiropractic medicine and 
Floridians benefiting from the applied research. 

Please support the start up appropriations in the Appropriations Bill. Thank 
you.

Subject: GOVERNOR'S FAMILY LITERACY INITIATIVE


Dear Governor Bush:

    We first met in 1990, when your mother unveiled the billboard at Ackerly 
Communications, "Spend Some Time With Your Kids, Literacy Begins At Home!"  I 
am a firm believer in Family Literacy and share your mother's passion.  Maybe 
that is what prompted me as a principal to apply for the Governor's Family 
Literacy Initiative.

    In Spring 2000, Miami Beach Adult & Community Education Center applied 
for and received a grant from the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy 
and the South Florida Annenberg Challenge through the Governor's Family 
Literacy Initiative to fund the "BISCAYNE FAMILY HERITAGE READING PROJECT."  
We entered into a collaborative relationship with Biscayne Elementary School 
of Miami Beach and the Historical Museum of South Florida.  The initiative 
has been very successful.

    Two weeks ago today, we met again on the cruise ship Fascination.  You 
gave us your e-mail address.  It was good to visit with your mother again.  
She allowed us to take a photo with one student participant of the Governor's 
Family Literacy Initiative.  

    I am happy to share  with you that Biscayne Elementary School soared on 
the FCAT test from a "C" school to an "A" school this year.  I believe that 
your initiative played a significant part in placing emphasis on family 
literacy and reading.  That emphasis coupled with the commitment of all the 
teachers and the faculty involved in the Family Literacy Initiative has to be 
credited with this overwhelming success!   Thank you for your support!

    As I told your mom, you and Liza McFadden, Miami Beach Adult & Community 
Education Center has once again applied for a Governor's Family Literacy 
Initiative Grant for 2001-2002 School Year to be operated at the Miami Beach 
Police Athletic League's Abe Resnick Youth Resource Center at 999 11th 
Street, Miami Beach.  

    If funded, it would give us the opportunity to use our experience at 
Biscayne Elementary School and to serve the children and parents of South 
Pointe, North Beach, and Fienberg-Fisher elementary schools on the southern 
tip of Miami Beach.  There is a great need for the initiative in that 
particular community.  

    We appreciate your support and your mother's loving generosity.  Please 
assist us to receive the Governor's Family LIteracy Initiative Grant this 
year.  We can make it so much better with the experience we gained at 
Biscayne last year.  

    Again, thank you!  It is always wonderful to share the "good news!"

                    Sincerely,

                    Bob Horton, Principal
                    Miami Beach Adult & Community Education Center

Good afternoon, 

I again want to thank you for coming to the Family CAFE and being so warm and 
open with families.  I enjoyed helping you work the crowd.  People sure 
appreciate all you've done to help improve the lives of both persons with 
disabilities and their families. 

Last week I had lunch with J. R.  Harding and in the course of our discussion 
he told me of his keen desire in being appointed as one of the new Trustees 
to Florida State University.  Furthermore, he made me really think about the 
importance of disability representation on all the Trustee boards for all 
universities. 

After listening to all of J.R.'s experience as a former Board of Regents 
student representative and his doctorate in educational systems of higher 
education I think he makes a very strong candidate for consideration. 

I would like to formally recommend J.R. Harding for your consideration. 

As you've seen, the passion and involvement of both advocates for and persons 
with disabilities can be a powerful and very often positive influence in 
improving the way government operates.  Please consider this opportunity to 
continue your leadership in improving the options and opportunities for 
persons with disabilities, their families, and our great state. 

Thanks again for your true passion and love of people.  You are making a 
difference!   

Have a great weekend.

the Independent Fire Control District Act. The bill 
declares the District to be an independent special district 
but does not make any substantive changes to current 
ordinances governing the District. There is a provision 
providing for a referendum concerning the collection of 
taxes to finance the District, and a provision authorizing 
the district to place liens on property. It also provides 
for annexing a portion of property presently within the 
Dorcas Fire District to provide the property owners greater 
protection.
 
	HB 1887, pertaining to the Dorcas Fire Control District, 
simply identifies that portion f the District to be 
transferred to the North Okaloosa Fire District to provide 
the possibility of more timely response time to the area.
 
	HB 1897, the Emerald Coast Bridge Authority bill, provides 
for changing the name from Fort Walton Beach Bridge 
Authority to the new name, and provides that the Governor 
will appoint a 5 member board.  Purpose of the Authority is 
to determine the need for a bridge or bridges to provide 
greater traffic access to Santa Rosa Island thereby 
relieving traffic congestion on Brooks Bridge.  It will be 
up to the authority members to determine location, method 
of funding, etc. The Authority is given the power to 
contract for any of the duties required under the 
legislation.
 
	"I want to thank each member of the delegation, Senators 
Charlie Clary and Durell Peaden, and Representatives Don 
Brown and Jeff Miller, for this cooperation and action in 
seeing that these measures were passed and approved by the 
Governor," Melvin said.

I would strong recommend for your consideration the appointment of the following individuals as University Board of Trustees members:

1. University of Florida:   Mr. Daniel Ponce

        Mr. Ponce is an active supporter of the University of Florida, has committed considerable time and energy in support of not only U.F. but also education in general.  He currently represents the UF as a Board member of the New World School of the Arts and has served recently as its Chair.  He is dedicated, fair, and passionate about enhancing the quality of the State's education program.  He would be an asset  to the University and its new Board.

2. Florida International University: Mr. Richard Zelman

        Mr. Zelman has been an active supporter of the University.  He is greatly involved in the Miami-Dade community and is a strong supporter of education and your initiatives.  You and the university could count on him to devote the time and effort necessary to serve as a trustee, and to provide the professionalism and integrity so important for this role.

Thank you for your consideration.

By the way, I was pleased to be able to represent Dr. Eduardo Padron  at the recent  kick-off of the reading initiative.  Your mother, as always, was delightful and I thought your presentation, including the email messages from those who had been in the reading programs, was especially well done.

We hope the Governor can play a key role, especially in light of Florida's

I will have Justin call him this morning. 

Ramba ignores one of the true reasons we are vetoing, the language that was added on the floor without debate that makes it unclear how broadly assessments may be used

The language he is discussing that went through committee allows counties to adjust assessments upwards without notifying the taxpayers, without a public hearing -- this would apply if the rates where raised or if there was not a "substantial change" in the purpose or use -- the bill does not define substantial -- in other words, counties, while administratively may be burdened by having hearings and noticed, could also use this language to raise assessments/adjust uses much easier without public input.

Governor, 

My name is David Ramba, a lawyer and lobbyist in Tallahassee.  I have 
continually been a supporter of yours and the Republican Party.  I chaired 
the Volunteer Committee and organized all of the volunteers for your 
inauguration, and was President of the Tallahassee YR's.  I would like you 
to read my information and listen to what I have to say about this piece of 
legislation. I don't come to folks for political favors for these types of 
issues, I work the legislative process that is established based on the 
legal and rational explanation of my client's issues. 

One of my clients I represent is special districts in the state of Florida, 
as well as the Association of Special Districts, Mosquito Control Districts, 
as well as being elected to a soil and water conservation district here in 
Leon County. I personally drafted provisions of SB 1020 to clarify a court 
case where the judiciary went to far in deciding a case about assessments 
and notice to property owners.  The bill, when taken in the context of the 
entire local government taxing procedure, is minor and technical in nature. 
It does not raise taxes - it makes for responsible, minor adjustments to the 
assessment so special districts, cities and counties are not keeping surplus 
funds of taxpayers when they have revenues that exceed expenses, and 
allowing them to adjust the assessment UNDER THE ORIGINAL CAP AND TERMS OF 
THE ORIGINAL NOTICE if minor adjustments are needed to raise the assessment 
to balance the budget.  Proprerty owners are still notified every year of 
any changes through the TRIM notice, and this allows for the local 
flexibility that was always intended in current law until this court case. 

This legislation went through 3 House Committees, 2 Senate Committees, and 
the House and Senate Floor with NO NEGATIVE VOTES.  The folks in your office 
did not say anything about this bill during the legislative session - I 
believe we have answered all of the questions they had.  Why would you veto 
this?  Jerry Bowman from your office has told Rep. Andrews and Senator 
Rossin's office that you are uncomfortable with this and it may be vetoed - 
I really cannot understand why...... 

I would appreciate a call on my cell phone at 443-4444 about this issue.

Governor, good morning!

Yesterday I received a fax from our state-wide trade association re: their
perspective on the possibility of your vetoing the proviso language in the
2001-02  KidCare Program  Appropriations  Bill.   I know how much you
support the children of this state and our county... and I know, too, how
much you support public/private partnerships.  I hope you remember that I
strongly support your views in this regard.   To that end, I am wondering if
it might be possible to set current  match levels as a floor in each county,
and than entice further matches with an increased ratio of state funding?
This step could continue each county's match level, perhaps entice greater
local investment and minimize the risk of  match dollars being diverted.
Just an idea,,,

We're doing some super things here at your United Way...you'd be pleased.
Perhaps at some time in the future,   you could find 30-40 minutes for  me

Governor Bush:
My name is Manny J. Delgado and I am a Vocational Teacher in Miami-Dade 
county and a registered voter.
This letter is to ask that you increase the rate of reimbursement for unused 
sick/vacation time to 100% versus 80%. The main reason for this is that the 
district pays me 100% of my salary to stay home and not teach and, they have 
to pay a substitute teacher. If I take that as unused leave, I only get 80% 
of my salary, it does not take a genious to realize that I am better off 
staying home collecting 100% of my salary.
Secondly, why limit the number of days you can accumulate and cash out at 
retirement? Teachers are very underpaid and overworked as it is, let us keep 
a little bit of what we have rightfully earned.

While I have your ear please do not allow any more monies to be taken away 
from Adult Vocational Education. We are killing Vocational Education in 
Florida and we know that all kids will not go to college and, persons coming 
off welfare rolls need to train for some professional occupation.
Vocational Education was intended to train persons to go into the workforce 
and we are killing that effort more and more as each  legislative session 
passes.

Thank You for your time

Since my phone has been ringing off the hook on this issue this morning I know that you are really getting lobbied.  I will be very short and direct.

I have spoken with Tony Grippa this morning and I am aware of his opinions.  I have also spoken with strong business leaders with progressive attitudes and here are the names we would like you to consider.
 
In no particular order:
 
Will Messer: he ran against Tony Grippa and is a bright young face in the Republican Party. His father is Elliott Messer, a long time well respected attorney.
 
Kim Williams: He is the owner of a local business , Marpan Supply, and is extremely well respected by the small business community including the minority community.  He leads the chamber effort in working with local businesses. He is a Democrat but supported you in both elections.
 
Jim Hunt: Jim is a Republican and the owner of a local technology company. He is very involved in the Economic Development movement and is on the chamber board.
 
The name of Ed Dupey has come up in conversations.  He has not been very active in the business community but in talking with several people he is well respected and certainly would be very acceptable to us.

Subject: FSU College of Chiropractic



Jeb, 
  
Thank you for taking the time to talk with me regarding the FSU College of Chiropractic last week.  Given the significant dollars that are being spent for the medical school, I share your concerns regarding the long term costs.  Here are the facts that you requested.

  
Based on data from FSU and the MGT report the total capital costs would be around $20 million.  Because of the  currently available and underutilized classroom space at FSU Panama City and Gulfcoast Community College, the capital outlay could be budgeted over a 3-4 year time span. According to the plan for FSU Panama City, these would be joint use facilities, including labs, a library, and a clinic. There has been talk about adding other health related programs (acupuncture, nutrition, massage therapy) which could utilize the same capital costs. 

  
According to the MGT study, approximately 700 Florida students matriculate annually at chiropractic schools across the country.  Many go to Life University in Atlanta, GA.  The program, while in close proximity to our state, has a longer program than other chiropractic schools (4 1/2 years vs. 4 years) but has the highest failure rate for the Florida Boards.  This program is also more costly than the other programs.  Florida, while ranked 3rd nationally in population, is the largest state without a chiropractic school (Texas has 2, California 5 and New York 1). 

  
The MGT report shows the average cost of private medical and chiropractic education to be around $120,000, vs. $55,000 in a public setting.  Several chiropractic school presidents have stated that this is one major reason why there is little ethnic diversity in chiropractic (5%). 

  
The legislature funded an implementation plan in 2000  that showed the need and validity of a publicly funded chiropractic school in Florida.  The profession is growing, there are more patients utilizing non surgical, drugless methods of health care ($13 billion spent by patients in 1998); there is a need for more practitioners in the chiropractic profession, given our population growth, our aging population, and the high costs of medical care, including drug and institutional costs.  This extensive study by MGT laid out a long range plan, unlike the medical school that was put into place over the objections of the BOR.

  
FSU would benefit with a new source of research dollars. The National Institute of Health has a $90 million grant program for alternative health care for this year. Given FSU's Research 1 accreditation, it could qualify for millions of dollars to fund various programs.  

  
The annual cost of $7-$8 million for the projected 500 students is the same amount of money spent if these were students entering any other FSU graduate program, therefore being budget neutral.  Many of us feel that our state has a responsibility educating our students rather than expecting other states to bear the cost. 

  
The local economic impact to the Panama City area would be tremendous.  The last private chiropractic school to open (Parker College in Fort Worth, Texas) has an annual fiscal impact of $25 million.

  
In summary Governor, I honestly do not see a downside for this program.   A health care program that the State of Florida will monitor and customize, teaching a more diverse group of physicians  due to lower costs to treat a growing and aging, more ethnically diverse population, utilizing a campus that is underused in an area that would greatly benefit economically.  Health care will soon be a top priority to all Floridians;  having the first publicly funded chiropractic program right here in our state would send a powerful message.  

Governor, please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you for your time.

Jeb--

I hope you and your family are doing well.  Connor and Kitty and great.

I have some stuff in HB 1053.  It will provide immediate (in relative terms)
relief for the traffic congestion on I-95.  It is a public/private
partnership between a company I represent and FDOT.  Easing traffic
congestion will allow South Fla citizens to be more productive and have a
beneficial impact on the economy and our way of life.

I hope you are able to support the bill.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Executive Office of the Governor
The Florida State Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush:

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) respectfully requests that you veto HB 69, an act which would remove certain drugs from Florida's Negative Formulary.

The Florida Board of Medicine and Board of Pharmacy placed certain critical dose drugs on the Negative Formulary because it is especially important that generic substitution of these drugs be carefully limited.  Drugs on the Negative Formulary, including anticonvulsants and anticoagulants, require careful calibration of dosage and close monitoring of the patient's response if they are to be used safely and effectively.

Because drugs declared bioequivalent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can differ in several respects, arbitrary changes in some situations can be life threatening.  Prescriptions for critical dose drugs, therefore, should not be switched to a generic alternative without the prescribing physician's explicit consent.

We believe that the practice of generic substitution should be carefully limited to situations that do not pose a risk to patients.  Patients who are effectively stabilized on a particular drug - whether a brand-name or a generic product - should remain on that product and not be forced to change drug therapy.  Florida's Negative Formulary provides this protection to patients.

In order to continue to protect the safety of Florida patients taking these products, we urge you to veto HB 69.

Sincerely,


Alan F. Holmer
President and CEO

Subject: Veto taking money from Hurricane Catastrophe Fund


Dear Governor Bush (Jeb):
    Please veto the proposed $20 million transfer of mney in the state budget 
from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe fund to finance flood control projects 
in Southeast Florida.  While these projects may be needed, the anticipated 
use of this money sets a bad precedent and will further raise windstorm 
insurance rates throughout the state.
    According to the Florida Department of Insurance, the average rate of 
increase for Floridians due to this budget item will be over 4 percent.  
However, due to local factors such as rish and location, the rate increase 
could be as high as 47.3%.  In another example, some homes Miami-Dade County 
could see a further $108 yearly rise in already soaring insurance premiums.  
Please help put a stop to these increases.
    I understand that insurance is another cost of doing business.  In 
Florida, however, windstorm rates continue to climb and threaten to put 
homeownership out of reach.  Again, I encourage you to do all you can to keep 
premiums down.  Please veto this budget item.
    On a personal note, I just sold a first home to a couple from Columbia, 
S.A, and their major concern was the high hurricane insurance rates.  I know 
you believe in diversity and equal opportunity and fulfilling the American 
Dream of home ownership.
    Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns on this matter.

Dear Governor Bush:

The Rural Issues Working Group (RIWG) has been working for several years to
positively impact issues addressed in the Florida Rural Economic
Development Strategy (FREDS).  HB 1225 contains a number of changes to
existing programs that were identified in the plan.  These changes include
the creation of a rural enterprise zone, and leveling the playing field
between rural and urban counties when applying for state grants.  We have
been working on these, as well as other rural economic development issues
since the completion of that plan in 1996.

On behalf of that group, I urge you to sign HB 1225 and allow it to become
law.  We desperately need parts of the bill that will allow us to improve
the ability of Florida's rural counties to compete for businesses that
create new jobs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush:

Your support for the school of chiropractic medicine at the FSU Panama City
campus is strongly urged. As a second generation alumnus, it will make me
proud for my alma mater to offer the best chiropractic medicine education
anywhere. The people of Florida will be the winners, especially minorities
and seniors when the school and its research facilities are fully
operational.They will benefit from the research results flowing from the
school working in tandem with the fully funded endowed Chair in Chiropractic
and Biomedical Mechanics Research.

It is important to emphasize that the school project has been through every
required review and study, including the Board of Regents the Postsecondary 
Education Planning Commission, leading to an exhaustive implementation play 
by M.G.T.

Floridians deserve the opportunity to study chiropractic medicine in their
home state at a state university and apply their first class education to 
their fellow Floridians. Minority students who have difficulty in meeting
tuition and costs of private, out of state chiropractic schools will benefit
from attending a state university at much more affordable costs.

As President of the National Association of Chiropractic Attorneys (which
provides the opportunity to broadly observe chiropractic on a nationwide 
basis), I am constantly reminded that Florida lacks adequate representation 
in the chiropractic profession among the black and Latin communities. Perhaps 
my sensitivity to this observation is emphasized
because I am Puerto Rican. But, the fact remains that there are fewer than 
10 black and 50 Latin chiropractors in Florida.

Utilization of the Panama City campus will provide educational as well as
economic opportunities to West Florida and provide a wise use of the FSU
facilities in conjunction with the Gulf Coast Community College. An
additional benefit can come from establishing a two year chiropractic
assistant program at the community college and share the facilities of both
campuses.

In short, the chiropractic college is a winner for FSU, Gulf Coast Community
College, Panama City, West Florida, Floridians who want to obtain their
education in Florida at the best school of chiropractic medicine and
Floridians benefiting from the applied research.

Please support the start up appropriations in the Appropriations Bill. Thank
you.

Subject: HB 1053 relating to Transportation and SB 1412 relating to
Child Safety Booster Seats


Governor Bush,

I wanted to take a moment and express my concerns regarding HB 1053 and SB
1412 that passed during the 2001 Legislative Session.  I think it is
important that we take a few minutes and remember the stump speeches that we
heard during the 2000 Election and their common themes, especially those of
our Republican colleagues:  Less Government, Lower Taxes, Individual
Freedom, Personal Responsibility and Family Empowerment.

I have been registered, volunteer and even serve on campaigns of many
Republican candidates, and many have been elected since the age of 18.
Since 1992, when Republican numbers started gaining in both Congress and the
Florida Legislature, many of us 'true believers' and 'I was Republican when
Republican was not Cool' spouted and supported legislation that followed our
theme of Less Government, Lower Taxes, Individual Freedom, Personal
Responsibility and Family Empowerment.

Now, my friends stripes are slowly fading.  The warning was when some of our
legislators stated that, "now that we're in the majority, we need to stay
and act like the majority."  Well wait a minute, that is what elected you -
the majority, they supported the stump speeches of Less Government, Lower
Taxes, Individual Freedom, Personal Responsibility and Family Empowerment.

Governor Bush, HB 1053 contains provisions requiring the use of safety
helmets for scooters....scooters.  I understand the concerns and horror
stories of the many injuries, but when will this stop?  Doesn't this go
against our themes of Less Government, Lower Taxes, Individual Freedom,
Personal Responsibility and Family Empowerment?  I understand that there is
piled into the bill other worthy provisions that warrant passage and your
signature, but we need to slow our Republican led legislature down.

SB 1412, this legislation has really taken me back.  When did Republican
stump speeches change from the theme of Less Government, Lower Taxes,
Individual Freedom, Personal Responsibility and Family Empowerment?  Did it
change the day that Senator Posey and Rep. Allen filed this intrusive
legislation on families?  Why is this necessary?  Could you imagine having
had to carry your three children in a booster seat until they were age 8?  I
would imagine that well over a majority of the families that have more than
one child will have to own more than one of these booster seats for several
years.  I'm just considering my situation, I'll have to tote around my two
children in a seat in my car for 9 to 10 years now (I'm rolling in the
overlapped time from when the 8 year old no longer has to be in it but his
sibling will).  What is next?  Are my Republican friends just going to
decide that they need to raise my children until the age of 18?  Governor
Bush, I thought those were the principals of our South Florida Democrats.

I have had conversations with other fellow Republicans and I think it is
time for our friends to sit down and review the 120 years worth of laws that
were passed when they were in the minority.  I'm willing to bet a campaign
contribution that they will find statutes in Florida Law that slaps of their
stump speeches of Less Government, Lower Taxes, Individual Freedom, Personal
Responsibility and Family Empowerment.

Governor Bush, I urge you to veto HB 1053 and SB 1412 because they are
intrusive on the average citizen of Florida.

Thank you in advance for your favorable consideration.

Jeb, should you seek re-election, you'll be swept into office as if caught in an avalanche if you approve funding for the redfish hatchery. It desperately needs to be moved ahead to follow  the phenomenal success trail blazed by Texas. 

Greatly improved redfish stocks will have a huge socio-economic impact on Florida, for the general public as well as for anglers.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Yesterday I sent an e-mail to you at your myflorida.com address.  Since then, I have learned that this address will reach your attention more quickly.  In the interest of expediency I am resending essentially the same messge; if you have already received this, please forgive my abuse of your inbox.
 
As you search for the best candidate to be appointed as an interim member to the seat held by Demetrio Perez, please consider Adriana Comellas-Macretti.  When I contacted Adriana yesterday to see if she would agree to have her name put forward, I felt that she has the qualities needed for this position.  Since hearing in the media of some other names being proposed, I am more convinced than ever that Adriana would be the best choice.
 
Ms. Macretti is a well respected Cuban-American.  Her character and record of ethical behavior are unblemished.  She is, as you know, a loyal Republican, but she has also been a leader in areas of the community that are not traditionally in the Republican circle.  I think that her leadership in the League of Women Voters and the Human Services Coalition is testament to her ability to be fair and to draw different points of view into consensus.
 
Adriana knows the school system well.  Her years of leading the Kids Voting organization have given her insight into the district's administration as well as knowledge of school site issues. She is not, however, a district insider.  She will have no pre-ordained loyalties nor any ax to grind.  Most importantly, I believe that Adriana will be fair but that she will be unafraid to take decisive action.  This School Board desperately needs members who meet those standards.
 
As you know, Adriana is currently employed by State Farm Insurance, and she continues to be active in civic and political organizations.  I would be happy to forward you a professional resume if needed.
 
Sincerely,
 
Anne Thompson

In the interest of expediency I am resending essentially the same messge; if you have already received this, please forgive my abuse of your inbox.
 
As you search for the best candidate to be appointed as an interim member to the seat held by Demetrio Perez, please consider Adriana Comellas-Macretti.  When I contacted Adriana yesterday to see if she would agree to have her name put forward, I felt that she has the qualities needed for this position.  Since hearing in the media of some other names being proposed, I am more convinced than ever that Adriana would be the best choice.
 
Ms. Macretti is a well respected Cuban-American.  Her character and record of ethical behavior are unblemished.  She is, as you know, a loyal Republican, but she has also been a leader in areas of the community that are not traditionally in the Republican circle.  I think that her leadership in the League of Women Voters and the Human Services Coalition is testament to her ability to be fair and to draw different points of view into consensus.
 
Adriana knows the school system well.  Her years of leading the Kids Voting organization have given her insight into the district's administration as well as knowledge of school site issues. She is not, however, a district insider.  She will have no pre-ordained loyalties nor any ax to grind.  Most importantly, I believe that Adriana will be fair but that she will be unafraid to take decisive action.  This School Board desperately needs members who meet those standards.
 
As you know, Adriana is currently employed by State Farm Insurance, and she continues to be active in civic and political organizations.  I would be happy to forward you a professional resume if needed.
 
Sincerely,
 
Anne Thompson

Subject: Leon County Commission Appointment


Hello Jeb,

Great job today.  After hearing the word today, I feel like plowing some
fields so that the grass roots (message) can spread.  Just let me know when
you are ready to take the mules out of the barn..... So much for my Alabama
colloquialisms.

May I suggest that Ed DePuy would be a good appointment for the new vacancy?
With thoughts toward the future special election, he has run in a countywide
race, did well against a popular de facto incumbent, can raise money, and
was
able to get better than usual minority support.

With only 27% Republican registration, Leon County has only had two county
wide elected Republican candidates in modern history.  Both were elected
under unusual circumstances.  One opponent was arrested prior to the general
election. So the odds will be against any Republican candidate in the
special
election.  With 25% or so AA registration, a strong AA Republican candidate
would be recommended, however we do not have anyone ready, able, and willing
at present.

I am sure you will get encouragement to appoint Travis Potter.  He is a good
man, but not yet ready for prime time.  Manny Joanos would not be a bad
choice, although he has high negatives associated with forgetting to file in
his last commission race.

Thanks for listening.

I'll be happy to call him.  This is the second person who told me that they "personally drafted"  the language in the bill.  I strongly disagree with his characterization of the legislation.  Even the Association of Counties representatives understand our concerns with the bill and volunteered to commit to "come back and fix it" next year.

I will have Justin call him this morning. 

Ramba ignores one of the true reasons we are vetoing, the language that was added on the floor without debate that makes it unclear how broadly assessments may be used

The language he is discussing that went through committee allows counties to adjust assessments upwards without notifying the taxpayers, without a public hearing -- this would apply if the rates where raised or if there was not a "substantial change" in the purpose or use -- the bill does not define substantial -- in other words, counties, while administratively may be burdened by having hearings and noticed, could also use this language to raise assessments/adjust uses much easier without public input.

Governor, 

My name is David Ramba, a lawyer and lobbyist in Tallahassee.  I have 
continually been a supporter of yours and the Republican Party.  I chaired 
the Volunteer Committee and organized all of the volunteers for your 
inauguration, and was President of the Tallahassee YR's.  I would like you 
to read my information and listen to what I have to say about this piece of 
legislation. I don't come to folks for political favors for these types of 
issues, I work the legislative process that is established based on the 
legal and rational explanation of my client's issues. 

One of my clients I represent is special districts in the state of Florida, 
as well as the Association of Special Districts, Mosquito Control Districts, 
as well as being elected to a soil and water conservation district here in 
Leon County. I personally drafted provisions of SB 1020 to clarify a court 
case where the judiciary went to far in deciding a case about assessments 
and notice to property owners.  The bill, when taken in the context of the 
entire local government taxing procedure, is minor and technical in nature. 
It does not raise taxes - it makes for responsible, minor adjustments to the 
assessment so special districts, cities and counties are not keeping surplus 
funds of taxpayers when they have revenues that exceed expenses, and 
allowing them to adjust the assessment UNDER THE ORIGINAL CAP AND TERMS OF 
THE ORIGINAL NOTICE if minor adjustments are needed to raise the assessment 
to balance the budget.  Proprerty owners are still notified every year of 
any changes through the TRIM notice, and this allows for the local 
flexibility that was always intended in current law until this court case. 

This legislation went through 3 House Committees, 2 Senate Committees, and 
the House and Senate Floor with NO NEGATIVE VOTES.  The folks in your office 
did not say anything about this bill during the legislative session - I 
believe we have answered all of the questions they had.  Why would you veto 
this?  Jerry Bowman from your office has told Rep. Andrews and Senator 
Rossin's office that you are uncomfortable with this and it may be vetoed - 
I really cannot understand why...... 

I would appreciate a call on my cell phone at 443-4444 about this issue.

Hi Governor,
 
Just a short note. I think Mr. Perez's replacement should come from his district. But even if Carlos Mannrique does live in that district, I would strongly advise you not to appoint him. 
 
I have attended many local functions with Carlos and I have NEVER heard him utter one word of support or encouragement  for your initiatives in school choice. To the contrary, he has on several occasions where I have been present seriously questioned your voucher efforts and school choice in general. 
 
I will, if it is helpful, offer my services as your appointee's aid, in any case.

Subject:	GOVERNOR'S FAMILY LITERACY INITIATIVE

Dear Governor Bush:

    We first met in 1990, when your mother unveiled the billboard at Ackerly 
Communications, "Spend Some Time With Your Kids, Literacy Begins At Home!"  I 
am a firm believer in Family Literacy and share your mother's passion.  Maybe 
that is what prompted me as a principal to apply for the Governor's Family 
Literacy Initiative.

    In Spring 2000, Miami Beach Adult & Community Education Center applied 
for and received a grant from the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy 
and the South Florida Annenberg Challenge through the Governor's Family 
Literacy Initiative to fund the "BISCAYNE FAMILY HERITAGE READING PROJECT."  
We entered into a collaborative relationship with Biscayne Elementary School 
of Miami Beach and the Historical Museum of South Florida.  The initiative 
has been very successful.

    Two weeks ago today, we met again on the cruise ship Fascination.  You 
gave us your e-mail address.  It was good to visit with your mother again.  
She allowed us to take a photo with one student participant of the Governor's 
Family Literacy Initiative.  

    I am happy to share  with you that Biscayne Elementary School soared on 
the FCAT test from a "C" school to an "A" school this year.  I believe that 
your initiative played a significant part in placing emphasis on family 
literacy and reading.  That emphasis coupled with the commitment of all the 
teachers and the faculty involved in the Family Literacy Initiative has to be 
credited with this overwhelming success!   Thank you for your support!

    As I told your mom, you and Liza McFadden, Miami Beach Adult & Community 
Education Center has once again applied for a Governor's Family Literacy 
Initiative Grant for 2001-2002 School Year to be operated at the Miami Beach 
Police Athletic League's Abe Resnick Youth Resource Center at 999 11th 
Street, Miami Beach.  

    If funded, it would give us the opportunity to use our experience at 
Biscayne Elementary School and to serve the children and parents of South 
Pointe, North Beach, and Fienberg-Fisher elementary schools on the southern 
tip of Miami Beach.  There is a great need for the initiative in that 
particular community.  

    We appreciate your support and your mother's loving generosity.  Please 
assist us to receive the Governor's Family LIteracy Initiative Grant this 
year.  We can make it so much better with the experience we gained at 
Biscayne last year.  

    Again, thank you!  It is always wonderful to share the "good news!"

                    Sincerely,

                    Bob Horton, Principal
