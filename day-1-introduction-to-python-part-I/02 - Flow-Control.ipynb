    "A loop is used to repeat a block of commands multiple times. There are two ways to write a loop, one is a `for` loop and the other is a `while` loop. Typically, you use a `for` loop when you know how many times you want to loop, and a `while` loop when looping is based on a conditional that will be modified during the loop.\n",
