# Crime and political corruption analysis using data mining, machine learning and complex networks

There has been a remarkable increasing in the amount of stored data by private and public companies. On one hand, these huge amounts of data enable a detailed historical review of the processes under investigation; on the other hand, this excess of data makes harder to extract summarized information and also to make good decisions supported by well-established empirical facts. This modern phenomenon has been called a big data and understanding these systems and extracting patterns from these data requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this sense, during the course at the [School of Applied Mathematics](http://www.cemeai.icmc.usp.br/component/k2/item/828-analise-de-crimes-e-corrupcao-politica-usando-mineracao-de-dados-aprendizado-de-maquina-e-redes-complexas) in the [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.icmc.usp.br/) at [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/) we will address topics that involve computer science, statistics, and physics. Among them, we should focus on the following ones:

* Introduction to Python;
* Web scraping; 
* Data mining;
* Machine learning;
* Complex networks.

Using these tools, we will focus on two issues that are of great relevance in Brazil: predicting homicides in cities and describing the mechanism behind political corruption networks. In the first topic, we will use machine learning techniques to predict the number of crimes in Brazilian cities. In the second theme, we will use the complex networks to describe the interaction between politicians investigated in corruption scandals in Brazil from 1987 to 2014.

Any comments, questions, or concerns can be directed to:

## Software Installation

This bootcamp uses the [Anaconda Python 3.7 distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)


**You must have Anaconda Python 3.7 installed before the first day of class**

We also require that you have a relatively modern operating system. 

For Windows, you must be using Windows 7 or later.

For Mac, you must be using OS X 10.9 or later.

## Downloading Course Materials

The course materials can be downloaded from the repository's [github page](https://github.com/lgaalves/school_crime_and_corruption_analysis). 
Just download the zip file, unzip it onto your Desktop, and rename the directory `school-of-applied-math`.

## Usage of Course Materials

This text and the majority of the course will conducted with Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>. Jupyter Notebook is a 'web-based interactive computational environment', meaning that it allows to write and execute python code in a web page from your own computers. Jupyter Notebook is a relatively new tool and we believe that is an excellent way to teach the basics of python programming and computational data analysis.

Jupyter Notebook is installed by default with the Anaconda Python distribution and can be laucnhed from the Anaconda Navigator program.
